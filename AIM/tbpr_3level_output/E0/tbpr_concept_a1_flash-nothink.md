### Narrative

**Strengths:**  
The concept is admirably clear about its non‑biological commissioning purpose. The explicit separation between “what is validated” and “what is not” is a strong sign of methodological rigor. Safety infrastructure (interlock, enclosure, goggles, UPS) is well considered. The linkage to the broader ecosystem (PhD, CDATA, MCAOA) is transparent and appropriate.  

**Weaknesses:**  
- **Hardware feasibility (score 3):** The LGY40‑C motorized stage stacked on a vintage Zeiss IM 35 is a hack that introduces multiple sources of mechanical backlash and drift. No vibration isolation is mentioned beyond “квартирный стол” (apartment table). For a 6‑month stability test, this is a serious risk. An optical table or at least a heavy granite slab should be mandatory.  
- **Timeline realism (score 3):** Six months for full commissioning of a custom AI‑driven optical system, with a single person (presumably you) managing hardware, firmware, agent layers, and iterative debugging, is extremely optimistic. Consider adding 2–3 months for troubleshooting and adding a second person part‑time.  
- **Biological relevance (score 3):** The concept states Elodea chloroplasts are stochastic and thus not a surrogate for centrioles. This is honest, but it raises the question: why not choose a more tractable testbed (e.g. fluorescent beads or fixed cells with known targets) to validate the tracking/ablation loop? The dichotomous “stochastic vs. deterministic” argument is insufficient; the agent will need to handle both, and chloroplasts may actually be harder to model than fixed targets.  

**Summary:** A well‑scoped engineering commissioning plan with realistic safety awareness, but hardware stability and timeline need re‑evaluation. The reviewer strongly recommends an optical table as a prerequisite.

*Corrected: #1 = 5, so sum = 44? Let me recalc: 5+5+3+4+5+5+2+4+2+4+5 = 44. Yes.*

### Narrative

**Strengths:**  
The AI‑agent architecture (Claude Code + DeepSeek router, Python tool functions) is well thought out and represents a genuine innovation in scientific decision‑making. The explicit link to Impetus LOI and Geiger Ulm for future funding shows strategic planning. The three‑tier safety check (firmware, interlock, OD4) is commendable.  

**Weaknesses:**  
- **Budget realism (score 2):** The document mentions $80k Phase A and $120k Phase B for Experiment A, but provides no cost breakdown for Experiment 0. What is the actual hardware budget for this commissioning? Laser diode? Arduino Nano? Stage controller? Enclosure? Even a minimal estimate (e.g., $5k–$10k) should be stated. Without it, the concept feels incomplete.  
- **Biological relevance (score 2):** I strongly disagree with the author’s dismissal of Elodea as a testbed. The claim that “Elodea ≠ mammalian centrioles” is true, but the purpose is *commissioning*, not biology. Chloroplasts are excellent for testing tracking, ablation precision, and agent decision loops because they are abundant and motile. The document should explicitly state *why* Elodea was chosen over simpler targets, and what metrics define commissioning success. Currently the “N” list (non‑validated) reads like an apology for a weak biological choice, which is unnecessary.  

**Additional critique:**  
- The risks list is good (laser type, optics, statistics, vibration) but none are quantified. For example, “Zeiss IM 35 objectives transmit <30% at 450 nm” – what does that mean for ablation energy? A simple calculation would help.  
- No mention of data storage, backup, or analysis pipeline for the 6‑month run.  

**Conclusion:** Promising technical idea, but lacking budget granularity and a clear pass/fail criterion for commissioning success. The biological choice is defensible with better justification.

### Narrative

**Overall assessment:**  
This is a solid engineering concept with clear self‑awareness of its limitations. The decision to write a *PEER_REVIEW_DRAFT.md* as a sister document is laudable. However, several critical operational details are missing.

**Key concerns:**

1. **Hardware feasibility (score 3):** Stacking a motorized XY stage on a Zeiss IM 35 via “adapter plate” is mechanically risky. The original stage is designed for manual fine positioning; adding a heavy LGY40‑C may introduce tilt. Has the weight been calculated? Are there any plans to reinforce the base? The document cites “vibration – квартирный стол” as a risk, but offers no mitigation (e.g., active isolation, rubber damping). I suggest adding a concrete slab or a low‑cost vibration isolation platform ($200‑$500).  

2. **Software / AI feasibility (score 5):** The agent layer is the project’s core. I appreciate the separation of real‑time (Arduino) from decision (Python/AI). However, no specifics are given about the failure mode handling: what happens if the agent loses network, the camera driver crashes, or the stage stalls? A system‑level watchdog should be described.  

3. **Timeline (score 3):** Six months for a single person to design, build, wire, code (firmware + Python tools + agent integration + safety interlocks), and test a complex optomechanical system is very tight. I recommend a phased plan: Month 1–2: hardware assembly and basic stage control; Month 3–4: laser integration and safety interlock; Month 5: agent integration with mock targets; Month 6: commissioning runs with Elodea.  

4. **Reproducibility (score 3):** No mention of version control for firmware, Python scripts, or AI agent logs. For a 6‑month commissioning, raw data, configuration files, and software versions must be archived. A simple statement of using Git, DVC, or equivalent would suffice.  

**Positive highlights:**  
- Explicit risk list including laser wavelength mismatch and UV coating is excellent.  
- Safety infrastructure is comprehensive (interlock, enclosure, goggles, UPS).  
- Connection to future Experiment A and funding sources is transparent.  

**Recommendation:** Address the hardware stabilisation, provide a phased timeline, and include a data management plan. The concept is otherwise sound.

## Combined Decision

| Reviewer | Sum (out of 55) |
|----------|----------------|
| A | 44 |
| B | 44 |
| C | 45 |

**Combined score (minimum sum): 44/55**  

**Decision:** **Minor revisions required** – The concept is technically sound and well‑scoped, but hardware stability (vibration, stage mounting) and timeline overoptimism must be addressed before proceeding. Additionally, a clear commissioning validation metric (e.g., “agent achieves 90% successful ablation of mobile chloroplasts over 72h without human intervention”) should be defined.

**Required revisions (based on reviewer consensus):**  
1. Describe vibration mitigation strategy (e.g., optical table, granite slab, or active isolation).  
2. Provide a phased 6‑month Gantt chart (or equivalent) with explicit milestones.  
3. Add a data management and version control plan.  
4. Clarify the commissioning success criteria (quantitative thresholds).  
5. Justify the choice of Elodea over simpler targets, or propose an alternative.  

**Acceptance condition:** After these revisions, the concept can proceed to hardware procurement and build.
