## Triple-Blind Peer Review (TBPR) — CDATA v5.3

### Summary for Decision

The revised document successfully addresses prior concerns about overconfidence and the misrepresentation of validation failures. However, the transformation from a "validated model" to a "hypothesis framework" remains incomplete. The ABL-2 paradox is now central, which is a strength, but the document still implicitly treats the centriolar hypothesis as *the* primary candidate despite the model's explicit failure. The experimental resolution pathway (H1–H4) is the most robust part of the document. The core weakness remains the lack of direct empirical evidence for the central claim (P0). The document is a strong *pre-experimental* framework, but its scientific value in the current form is limited to a thought experiment.

### Reviewer #1 (Computational Biologist / Modeler)

**Overall Tone:** The model failure is handled well, but the framing still carries a survivor bias. The four-hypothesis table is excellent.

**Score: 38/55**

| Criterion | Score (1-5) | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Hypotheses & Goals | 4 | Clearly defined. The shift to a falsification framework is correct. Goal is now to resolve a paradox, which is appropriate. |
| 2. Theoretical Foundation | 4 | The deductive argument is strong (¬R argument). The reliance on the "most parsimonious" claim is justified, though it is not a proof. |
| 3. Design / Methodology | 2 | **Critical Flaw.** The "resolution" of the ABL-2 paradox via the non-linear re-specification (`k_ep`) is hand-wavy. You don't show that this resolves the issue. The model is described as "failing," yet you propose a fix without running the numbers. This is a core methodological weakness. **Pre-registration of the analysis code for v4.0 is not enough; you need to show the simulated result of the fix.** |
| 4. Experimental Predictions | 5 | P0 is perfect. The table (H1-H4) is the strongest part of the paper. It explicitly defines success and failure, which is rare and valuable. |
| 5. Data & Reproducibility | 3 | Code private, no DOI. "Private until submission" is a limitation. For a paper where the primary validation fails, the code is *essential* for review. This should be a zero-access peer review repository (e.g., CodeOcean capsule). |
| 6. Clarity & Structure | 4 | Excellent restructuring. The "ABL-2 Paradox: Central Finding" section is a model of scientific honesty. The Executive Summary now matches the reality of the paper. |
| 7. Evidence for Claims | 2 | The model (the primary evidence) is a negative result. The literature support remains correlative. The re-specification claim is untested. Claims about "most likely candidate" outpace the evidence. |
| 8. Handling of Limitations | 5 | Limitations are frankly stated. P0 is correctly identified as the blocker. The overfitting confession is good. |
| 9. Novelty & Significance | 4 | High novelty in the approach (explicit falsification). If the H1-H4 table is resolved, it will be significant. Currently, it is a well-structured dead end, which has scientific value. |
| 10. Literature Context | 4 | Good integration with MCAOA. The ABL-2 paradox correctly places this in the context of epigenetic clocks. |
| 11. Ethics & Feasibility | 3 | Feasible. The $30K cost for P0 is modest and well-scoped. The ethics are standard. The lack of *in vivo* HSC manipulation at this stage is a realistic scope. |

**Overall:** A very strong theoretical framework that is honest about its own failure. The methodology for the *resolution* (the `k_ep` term) is currently speculative. **Score: 38/55.**

### Reviewer #2 (Cell Biologist / Aging Researcher)

**Overall Tone:** The biology feels thin. The move from "polyGlu on centrioles" to "HSC exhaustion" is still a giant leap. The ABL-2 paradox is a good reason to stop and think, but the document tries to sprint past it.

**Score: 29/55**

| Criterion | Score (1-5) | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Hypotheses & Goals | 3 | The goal is to "resolve the paradox," but the document heavily implies H1 is the truth. The hypothesis framing is better, but the centriolar hypothesis is still given priority in funding. I would re-weight the H1–H4 probabilities. |
| 2. Theoretical Foundation | 3 | The ¬R argument is logical, but it relies on a mechanistic link (ciliopathy → niche sensing failure) that is weak. Many things can cause "division limit in hypoxia." The centriole is not the *only* ¬R candidate. |
| 3. Design / Methodology | 2 | The model is a black box. The 32 parameters are a classic overfit. The "validation" via R² on a literature-derived average trajectory is weak. Leave-one-out giving negative R² is a red flag. The model is not a valid tool for biological inference as presented. |
| 4. Experimental Predictions | 4 | P0 is the only truly novel prediction. P1-P11 are mostly "centriolar damage correlates with X." The H1-H4 table is good, but it is a taxonomy of ignorance, not a set of specific mechanistic predictions. |
| 5. Data & Reproducibility | 1 | **Critical Flaw.** No primary data. All figures from literature aggregates. The model code is private. This paper is a mathematical argument supported by a closed-source simulation. For a biology paper, this is unacceptable. |
| 6. Clarity & Structure | 5 | The document is exceptionally well-structured for its complexity. The shift in language from v5.2 is clearly executed. |
| 7. Evidence for Claims | 2 | The central claim ("centriolar damage is a clock") has no direct in-vivo evidence. The model fails to support it. The literature evidence is purely correlative. The "most parsimonious" argument is a logical fallback, not evidence. |
| 8. Handling of Limitations | 4 | The limitations are stated, but the tone often contradicts them. "This is a discovery" is an example of framing a failure as a success. It is a discovery that your model is broken, not that biology is broken. |
| 9. Novelty & Significance | 3 | The idea is interesting and worth a pilot. The negative result is the real novelty. If published as a "failed hypothesis with a rescue plan," it could be valuable. As presented, it feels like a grant proposal trying to justify a pet theory. |
| 10. Literature Context | 4 | Good references to Peters-Hall, Horvath, Jaiswal. The MCAOA integration is a strength, placing the failure in a larger context. |
| 11. Ethics & Feasibility | 4 | Feasible. Mice are standard. H2B-GFP dilution is a viable technique. The P0 test is a single sensible experiment. |

**Overall:** The paper describes a failed computational model with a speculative biological hypothesis. The P0 experiment is the only thing that matters. The rest is post-hoc rationalization. This is an honest but thin document. **Score: 29/55.**

### Reviewer #3 (Methodologist / Philosopher of Science)

**Overall Tone:** A superb example of a "post-falsification" hypothesis framework. The structure is a template for other aging research. However, the document still confuses "presenting a failure" with "validating a method."

**Score: 33/55**

| Criterion | Score (1-5) | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Hypotheses & Goals | 5 | Excellent. The document explicitly states its own falsification. This is a rare and admirable scientific posture. The goal is now an experimental resolution, which is crisp. |
| 2. Theoretical Foundation | 4 | The deductive argument is formally rigorous (if A, then B; not B; therefore not A). The conclusion ("not full") is correct. The leap to "centriole is the only answer" is a valid scientific hypothesis, but it is not deductively closed. |
| 3. Design / Methodology | 3 | **The critical issue is inference.** The model fails. The document infers: "The hypothesis is still valid, the model is just misspecified." This is the "death by a thousand qualifications." The H1-H4 table is a good methodology for *experimental* resolution, but it accepts a burden of proof that the document currently lacks. |
| 4. Experimental Predictions | 5 | The table is a perfect use of the "strong inference" framework (Platt, 1964). Each H is falsifiable by a single experiment. This is the gold standard. |
| 5. Data & Reproducibility | 2 | No data. The model code is not reviewable. The claim "all figures are reproducible from public data" is unverifiable without the scripts. The promise to "pre-register" is good, but only on the *experimental* side. The computational side is opaque. |
| 6. Clarity & Structure | 4 | Clear. The "ABL-2 Paradox" section is exemplary. The shift from v5.2 is detectable and honest. |
| 7. Evidence for Claims | 2 | The claim "centriolar clock is most parsimonious" is a truth claim. The evidence is a logical argument (which can be valid) and a failed model. This is insufficient for a scientific claim. The evidence is only sufficient to justify *testing* the claim, not to *assert* it. |
| 8. Handling of Limitations | 4 | Well-handled, but the document still frames the failure as a "strong result." It is a strong *negative* result for the *model*, but a weak result for the *hypothesis*. The distinction is subtle but important. I would phrase it as: "We built a model. It failed. This tells us we need better biology." |
| 9. Novelty & Significance | 4 | High novelty in the meta-scientific approach. If published, this could be a milestone in how aging models are presented. The ABL-2 paradox is a genuine contribution. |
| 10. Literature Context | 3 | Lacks context on *other* potential ¬R candidates. What about the nuclear envelope? The Golgi? The lysosome? The document only compares against telomeres and ROS, but there are other structural candidates. |
| 11. Ethics & Feasibility | 4 | Ethical. The 30K cost is realistic. The timeline is optimistic but plausible. |

**Overall:** The document is a philosophical and methodological success but a scientific exercise. It correctly identifies a paradox and builds a framework to resolve it. However, it fails to provide new empirical evidence or a validated model. It is a 5/5 for meta-science and a 2/5 for biology. **Score: 33/55.**

### Editorial Recommendation

**Major Revision required.**

The combined score of **29/55** is low but not catastrophic. The document has a fatal flaw: it claims to be a hypothesis framework, but the core hypothesis (centriolar clock) still receives preferential treatment despite the model's failure. To proceed, the authors must:

1.  **Run the re-specified model.** The `k_ep` term must be simulated. Show that the ABL-2 paradox is *resolved* mathematically, not just asserted.
2.  **Release the model code.** For a paper built on a computational failure, the code must be open for review. A private GitHub repo is insufficient.
3.  **Tone down the advocacy.** The text should read: "Hypothesis H is possible. It is not supported by our model. Test it with P0." Not: "Our model failed, but H is still the best guess."
4.  **(Optional but recommended) Reduce the parameter count.** 32 parameters for 35 data points is indefensible. Show a simpler minimal model.

The H1-H4 experimental table is publishable as a standalone "origin of the ABL-2 paradox" paper if the model becomes rigorous. Currently, it is a justification for a grant, not a complete scientific paper.
