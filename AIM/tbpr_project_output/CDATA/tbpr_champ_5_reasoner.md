## Review Criteria (11 items, each scored 1–5)

| # | Criterion | Description |

## Reviewer 1 (Critical — Focus on methodological flaws)

| Criterion | Score | Comments |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 3 | Hypothesis is clear but the central claim – "most parsimonious candidate" – is still presented as though it has special logical status beyond a plausible guess. |
| 2 | 2 | The ¬R argument confuses *necessity* with *sufficiency*. Many structures satisfy the criteria (e.g., asymmetric histone segregation, mitochondrial heteroplasmy). The claim of "most parsimonious" is subjective. |
| 3 | 2 | The model is overparameterized (32 params, ~35 data points). The ABL-2 paradox is expected, not surprising. The fix (adding interaction terms) just adds more parameters. No cross-validation on independent data. |
| 4 | 4 | The handling of the ABL-2 paradox is the strongest part of the document. The decision tree and three hypotheses are well-thought-out. |
| 5 | 3 | P0 is feasible, but $35K for STED + sorting seems low. Antibody validation and breeding of H2B-GFP mice will likely raise costs to $60K+. |
| 6 | 5 | Excellent open science practices: preregistration, Zenodo, GitHub. |
| 7 | 3 | The multi-organism evidence table is correlative and cherry-picked. No mention of cilia-independent centriolar functions (e.g., in lymphoblasts). |
| 8 | 3 | The impact is moderate; the main result so far is that a simple model fails. That's not a discovery. |
| 9 | 4 | The falsification approach is good – alternative hypotheses are explicitly listed. |
| 10 | 4 | Limitations are acknowledged, but #5 (alternative ¬R) is brushed aside too quickly. |
| 11 | 3 | The document is well-organized but still reads as defensive. The executive summary still calls the hypothesis "deductively constrained" – this is overreach. |
| **Total** | **36/55** | |

## Reviewer 2 (Moderate — Balanced assessment)

| Criterion | Score | Comments |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 4 | The hypothesis is now clear after revisions. The "corrected statement" is honest. |
| 2 | 3 | The logical argument is better, but still leans too heavily on "most parsimonious." Parsimony is a heuristic, not a proof. |
| 3 | 3 | Model comparison (28 subsets) is a good addition, but the top model (M1) lacks any centriolar component – this should be highlighted more strongly. The AIC/BIC values are close; ΔAIC < 2 is not strong evidence. |
| 4 | 5 | Excellent handling of the paradox. The decision tree is clear and actionable. This is the best part of the document. |
| 5 | 4 | P0 is feasible, but the timeline (8 weeks) is optimistic. Sorting HSCs, H2B-GFP dilution, and STED imaging requires careful scheduling. |
| 6 | 5 | Perfect – all code, data, and preregistration are public. |
| 7 | 4 | Good integration with MCAOA and aging clocks. However, more discussion of why other ¬R mechanisms were excluded would strengthen the argument. |
| 8 | 4 | If the experiments distinguish H1–H3, the impact could be high regardless of outcome. |
| 9 | 5 | The falsification approach is rigorous, especially the contingency plan for null P0. |
| 10 | 4 | Limitations are well-covered, though the post-mitotic aging gap is concerning. |
| 11 | 4 | The document is well-structured and the ABL-2 paradox is correctly repositioned as the primary finding. |
| **Total** | **45/55** | |

## Reviewer 3 (Supportive — Emphasis on novelty and openness)

| Criterion | Score | Comments |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 5 | The hypothesis is novel, clearly stated, and distinct from telomere/ROS theories. |
| 2 | 4 | The deductive argument, though not watertight, is honestly presented as a "strong hypothesis." The language correction is appreciated. |
| 3 | 4 | The model is a good formalization, but I agree that more work is needed (interaction term). The systematic subset comparison is a major improvement over v5.3. |
| 4 | 5 | The handling of the ABL-2 paradox is exemplary. Many projects would have buried the negative result. Here it is front and center. |
| 5 | 4 | P0 is doable, but the cost estimate may be too low. Recommend adding a 20% contingency. The power analysis is sound. |
| 6 | 5 | Outstanding: preregistration, public repositories, all reproducibility measures taken. |
| 7 | 4 | Good integration with MCAOA. The table of multi-organism evidence is useful. |
| 8 | 5 | The project has high potential: even a null result (H3) would redirect the field. |
| 9 | 5 | The decision tree makes the project fully falsifiable. |
| 10 | 5 | Limitations are dealt with honestly. The post-mitotic aging gap is acknowledged and left as an open question. |
| 11 | 5 | The document is clear, concise, and professionally written. The improvements from the previous review are evident. |
| **Total** | **51/55** | |

## Overall Editorial Decision

**Revision required.** The manuscript is scientifically sound in its revised form, but Reviewer 1's criticisms regarding overparameterization and the logical status of the hypothesis remain significant. The authors should:

1. **Reduce the model’s parameter count** or provide a simpler toy model that captures the same dynamics.
2. **Strengthen the justification against alternative ¬R mechanisms** (e.g., a one-paragraph discussion of mitochondrial heteroplasmy).
3. **Acknowledge the ΔAIC < 2 between M1 and M2** and discuss model selection uncertainty.
4. **Provide a more realistic budget breakdown** for P0 with contingency.
5. **Remove the phrase “deductively constrained” from all but the methodological explanation** to avoid overclaiming.

If these revisions are made, the document will be suitable for archiving as a pre-experimental hypothesis framework. The experimental program (especially P0) is well-designed and should be encouraged.
