### Review 1 — Reviewer ID: LV-23 (Focus: Hypothesis Logic & Biological Plausibility)

**Overall Score:** 45 / 55

| # | Criterion | Score (1-5) | Comments |
|---|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Scientific Rigor | 4 | Strong deductive foundation. The ABL-2 paradox presentation is honest and scientifically mature. The framing as a hypothesis framework is appropriate. |
| 2 | Clarity of Central Argument | 5 | The ¬R argument is now correctly communicated as a parsimonious candidate, not a proof. The Russian section is well-translated and contextualized. |
| 3 | Use of Existing Literature | 5 | Excellent coverage of the Hayflick limit in hypoxia literature and polyGlu signaling. However, I would strengthen the discussion of alternative ¬R candidates (e.g., mitochondrial heteroplasmy, which also satisfies division-proportionality under some models). |
| 4 | Logical Consistency | 4 | The four hypothesis resolution table is a major strength. However, H2 and H3 are essentially the same interaction space; consider merging them into a single "interaction-dependent" hypothesis for cleaner experimental design. |
| 5 | Experimental Feasibility | 5 | P0 is well-chosen and cost-effective. The timeline is realistic. The decision tree is clear. |
| 6 | Handling of Falsification | 5 | This is the document's strongest feature. Transforming a model failure into a discovery is rare and commendable. |
| 7 | Multi-Organism Evidence | 4 | The supporting evidence table is persuasive but remains correlative. I would like to see a stronger statement that this evidence is context-dependent (e.g., cilia-independent centriolar functions in non-ciliated cells). |
| 8 | Integration with MCAOA | 4 | The ABL-2 paradox genuinely strengthens the MCAOA framework. However, the appendix is too brief. This should be woven into the main text to show how a single-counter failure informs multi-counter integration. |
| 9 | Limitations Acknowledgment | 5 | Comprehensive. The P0 blocking problem and model overfitting are correctly elevated. |
| 10 | Open Science Plan | 3 | The "private until submission" clause is a significant weakness. Pre-registration is promised but not yet submitted. For a TBPR, I would require that the code and data for all figures be deposited upon submission of this document, not the final manuscript. |
| 11 | Overall Impact | 4 | The document is a useful negative result, but its impact hinges entirely on P0. Without that experiment, it remains an elegant but untestable speculation. Priority should be conditional on P0 pre-registration. |

**Summary Comment (Reviewer LV-23):**  
This is a well-structured hypothesis document that correctly prioritizes its own falsification. The ABL-2 paradox is treated with appropriate seriousness. I support funding for P0, with the condition that the pre-registration and data/code repositories are made public before funding release. The document would benefit from merging H2 and H3 into a single interaction hypothesis and expanding the MCAOA integration.

### Review 2 — Reviewer ID: CM-87 (Focus: Computational Modeling & Statistical Methods)

**Overall Score:** 38 / 55

| # | Criterion | Score (1-5) | Comments |
|---|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Model Correctness | 3 | The ODE model is a reasonable formalization, but the additive specification between centriolar and epigenetic damage is a known error. The planned non-linear coupling in v4.0 is necessary but should have been discovered during calibration, not post-validation. |
| 2 | Parameter Justification | 2 | 32 parameters fitted to ~35 data points is a critical overfitting risk. The LOO-CV R² = -0.093 confirms this. The authors acknowledge this but do not adequately explain why a simpler model (e.g., 5-parameter logistic) was not attempted first. |
| 3 | Sensitivity Analysis Validity | 4 | Sobol analysis is correctly implemented (Saltelli method, N=16,384). However, the interpretation of S1 vs ST is unclear: the difference between S1 and ST for β_epi (0.403 vs 0.51) suggests significant non-linear interactions that are not explored. |
| 4 | Ablation Test Methodology | 5 | The ABL-1/ABL-2 logic is clean and correctly interpreted. This is a model of how to present a negative validation. |
| 5 | Falsification Logic | 5 | The statement "this does not disprove the hypothesis, only the model" is statistically sound. The experimental resolution pathway is logically necessary. |
| 6 | Model Specification Quality | 2 | The choice of a saturating function for centriolar damage and a linear function for epigenetic damage is a textbook case of comparing a non-linear model to a linear one when the true process is unknown. This should have been flagged during internal review. The suggestion that a linear centriolar function would resolve this is plausible but not tested. |
| 7 | Reproducibility | 3 | Code not public. The promise of future release is insufficient for a TBPR. I assign a score of 3 only because the analytical methods (Sobol, LOO-CV) are standard and could be reconstructed. |
| 8 | Statistical Reporting | 3 | Confidence intervals for R² are not reported. A bootstrap analysis (N=1000) of the LOO-CV R² would provide a stronger basis for the claim that the model is "worse than a constant baseline." |
| 9 | Alternative Model Exploration | 1 | The authors test exactly two models: full and ablated. A systematic model comparison (AIC/BIC across all 28 possible parameter combinations) is missing. The claim that "removing the centriolar component improves accuracy" is based on a single comparison with a single alternative. |
| 10 | Pre-Registration | 3 | P0 pre-registration is promised but not executed. The submission requirement should be a link to a live OSF page. |
| 11 | Overall Impact | 4 | The negative result is valuable, but the model specification errors reduce confidence that the experimental program will resolve the paradox rather than confirm H4 (third mechanism). |

**Summary Comment (Reviewer CM-87):**  
The computational core of this document is significantly weaker than its biological framing. The ABL-2 paradox is real, but it is at least partially an artifact of model specification. I recommend mandatory pre-registration of the v4.0 model specification (with the non-linear coupling) before funding can be approved. I also require a systematic model comparison across all 28 parameter subsets, with AIC/BIC, before the revised manuscript is submitted. Without these, the experimental program risks being a fishing expedition.

### Review 3 — Reviewer ID: QA-41 (Focus: Experimental Design & Feasibility)

**Overall Score:** 41 / 55

| # | Criterion | Score (1-5) | Comments |
|---|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Primary Test Design | 4 | P0 (GT335-STED in HSC) is a clean, direct test. The comparison of young vs old and TTLL6-KD vs control is appropriate. However, the cost estimate ($30K) seems low for a STED microscopy study with sorted HSCs. Please provide a breakdown. |
| 2 | Sample Size Justification | 3 | N=10 per group is stated without power analysis. What is the expected effect size for GT335 fluorescence in 2-month vs 18-month mice? A power calculation based on pilot data from another cell type is needed. |
| 3 | Mechanistic Resolution | 4 | The four hypotheses are well-separated. However, H2 and H3 are not fully orthogonal. I echo Reviewer LV-23's recommendation to merge into a single "interaction-dependent" hypothesis. |
| 4 | Alternative Outcomes | 5 | The document correctly states that all four outcomes are publishable. This is rare and commendable. The funding agency should commit to publishing any of the four outcomes. |
| 5 | Feasibility (Time & Cost) | 4 | The 8+4 week timeline for P0 is realistic if sorted HSCs are available. The $45K total cost is reasonable, but I note that TTLL6-KD validation requires an additional antibody cost that is not listed. |
| 6 | Risk Mitigation | 3 | There is no plan for what happens if GT335-STED shows no difference between young and old HSCs. H4 would be supported, but the document offers no alternative experimental path. A contingency plan (e.g., testing polyE instead of polyGlu, or examining centrosome numbers) should be added. |
| 7 | Ethical Considerations | 5 | No concerns. The proposed experiments are standard for mouse models. |
| 8 | Replicability | 4 | GT335-STED is a published protocol. However, the specific sample preparation for sorted HSCs may require optimization. Consider including a positive control (e.g., brain tissue known to show age-associated polyGlu changes). |
| 9 | Personnel Expertise | 4 | The document does not name the team. I assume expertise exists, but the review must note that STED microscopy of sorted HSCs requires specialized training. |
| 10 | Integration with Downstream Predictions | 3 | The document lists P1-P11 but does not provide a clear decision tree for which experiments to perform after P0, depending on the outcome. This is a significant omission. |
| 11 | Overall Feasibility | 4 | The P0 experiment is feasible and well-designed. The lack of a contingency plan and the unclear decision tree reduce the score slightly. |

**Summary Comment (Reviewer QA-41):**  
The experimental plan is focused and cost-effective. I support funding for P0 with the following conditions: (1) Provide a power analysis based on published GT335 data in other cell types; (2) Add a contingency plan for a null result in P0 (e.g., test polyE or examine other centriolar markers); (3) Provide a clear decision tree linking P0 outcomes to the selection of subsequent P1-P11 experiments. The pre-registration requirement is appropriate.

**Combined Score (MIN):** 38 / 55

**Verdict:** **Major Revisions Required**  
The document demonstrates rigorous self-critique and a clear falsification path, but the computational model's specification errors, the lack of public code/data, and the missing contingency plan prevent immediate acceptance. Revision should focus on:
1. Pre-registering P0 and making all code/data public.
2. Conducting a systematic model comparison (28 subsets) with AIC/BIC.
3. Adding a contingency plan for a null P0 result.
4. Merging H2 and H3 into a single interaction hypothesis.
5. Providing a power analysis for P0.

**Recommendation:** Conditional funding for P0, pending submission of revisions (items 1–5) within 60 days.
