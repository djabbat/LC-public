# BioSense — State

**Date:** 2025-04-01  
**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Status:** 🟡 In Development

## Goals & Tasks

**Primary Goal:** Develop a biological data monitoring and analysis system for medical research, enabling real-time anomaly detection and predictive insights.

**Key Objectives (with priorities, deadlines, and owners):**

| Objective | Priority | Deadline | Owner |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------|
| Design and implement data ingestion pipeline (supports HL7 FHIR, CSV, JSON) | P0 | 2025-05-15 | Owner: Lead Developer |
| Build core ML models for anomaly detection (vital signs, lab results) | P1 | 2025-06-30 | Owner: ML Engineer |
| Develop user dashboard (real-time visualization, alerts) | P2 | 2025-07-15 | Owner: Frontend Developer |
| Integrate with hospital EMR systems (pilot) | P1 | 2025-08-01 | Owner: Integration Lead |
| Conduct clinical validation study with 100+ patients | P2 | 2025-09-15 | Owner: Medical Expert |
| Achieve HIPAA/GDPR compliance certification | P0 | 2025-10-01 | Owner: Compliance Officer |

## Current Phase

- **Accomplishments:** Project concept and plan (CONCEPT.md) completed. Core documentation (README, LICENSE, STATE) finalized. Team assembled: Project Lead, 2 Developers, Medical Expert. Development environment set up (GitHub repo, CI/CD pipeline, Docker containers). Initial architecture design reviewed and approved.
- **Next Steps:** Begin data ingestion pipeline implementation (prerequisite for ML models). Finalize EMR API integration contract with partner clinic. Set up GPU cluster for ML training (blocker resolution in progress).
- **Current focus:** Data ingestion pipeline (P0) – HL7 FHIR parser development, CSV/JSON schema validation.
