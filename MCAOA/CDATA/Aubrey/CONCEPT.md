# Aubrey — 6-Month Centriole Age Tracking Platform

**Formal grant title (per signed LoS Parrish 2026-04-22 and Geiger 2026-04-23):** *AI-Directed Pure-Lineage Test of Counter #1 (Centriolar) in the Multi-Counter Architecture of Organismal Aging (MCAOA)*

**Phase A equipment name:** **ARGUS-LP** — *AI-Resident Robotic Genealogical Ultra-surveillance for Lineage Purification.* A purpose-built COTS-assembled live-cell imaging station (not a Zeiss retrofit), designed from scratch for 24/7 AI-agent-driven continuous live-cell observation over the 6-month tracking window. The Argus mythological reference is intentional: 24/7 multi-month autonomous surveillance of a slowly-drifting cellular phenotype is a function that no human-operated workflow can deliver. ARGUS-LP is Phase A's capital deliverable; it remains the property of GLA at the end of the grant. Two identical units are built (see §Budget): Unit #1 at GLA Abastumani, Unit #2 at an independent replication site (Zheleznov, LoS pending). Engineering subcontractor G. Tsomaia (Dipl. Ing. Tbilisi Polytechnic) handles design and assembly.

**Parent project:** [CytogeneticTree (CellLineageTree)](../CONCEPT.md)
**Created:** 2026-05-09; **scope revised 2026-05-12: from 48 h pilot → 6-month tracking programme** aligned with the parent project's quantitative predictions P5 (50-passage polyGlu trend; reachable in ~6 mo at 1 division/day from passage 25 → 50) and partial coverage of P11 (relapse half-life ~40–60 divisions; full 80–120 divisions in Phase B). The 48 h figure is retained only as the *duration of one continuous time-lapse imaging block*, not the duration of the whole experiment.
**Status:** Pre-funding proposal stage. No pilot data exist yet; this CONCEPT describes the planned design.

## Pilot Data Timeline

| Phase | Week | Activity | Deliverable | Go/no-go |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pilot 1 | 1-2 | RITE construct in BJ-hTERT (3 clones) | Expression confirmed | >70% cells labeled |
| Pilot 2 | 3 | Asymmetry rate (≥100 divisions) | Rate ≥10%? | Proceed if yes |
| Pilot 3 | 4 | Ablation on beads (50 shots) | Efficiency ≥70%? | Proceed if yes |
| Review | 5 | Go/no-go | Both ≥ threshold? | Full exp. / Layer 1 |
| Full | 6-26 | 5/9 imaging blocks × 48h | 250 tracks | — |

**Falsifiability:** If centriole pair asymmetry rate < 10% OR ablation efficiency < 70% in pilot (n=3 clones, 48h time-lapse), the ARGUS-LP platform is redirected to passive tracking (no ablation) and the centriolar damage hypothesis is rejected for HSCs.

**Validation plan:**
- Pilot 1: RITE construct expression in BJ-hTERT (n=3 clones, week 1-2)
- Pilot 2: Asymmetry rate measurement (n=100 divisions, week 3)
- Pilot 3: Ablation efficiency on test beads (n=50 shots, week 3)
- Go/no-go after week 4: asymmetry ≥10% AND ablation ≥70% → proceed

**Power analysis (lineage reconstruction):**
- Cell-DT simulation (n=439 tests): minimal detectable effect = 0.15 divisions/cell
- 5/9 imaging blocks × 50 tracks/block = 250 tracks
- Mixed-effects model: power > 0.85 at α = 0.05

**Go/no-go criteria:**
| Criterion | Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Asymmetry rate | ≥10% | Proceed to full ablation |
| | <10% | Switch to passive tracking (mEos3.2) |
| Ablation efficiency | ≥70% | Proceed to automated ablation |
| | <70% | Switch to manual ablation (operator) |
| Cell cycle | ≥1 division/day | Proceed to 6-month timeline |
| | <1/day | Extend timeline to 12 months |

## Temporal architecture

| Layer | Duration | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Imaging block | 24–72 h continuous time-lapse | One uninterrupted run; 3–5 generations per lineage tracked |
| Imaging cycle | every 2–3 weeks | One block of continuous imaging + 1–2 weeks of unsupervised passaging in incubator |
| Total experimental window | **6 months** | ≥ 9 imaging blocks; cells age from passage 25 → ~passage 50 (~25 cumulative divisions in continuous culture) |
| Optional Phase B extension | +12 months in vivo at Ulm | HSC competitive BMT to reach the full P11 relapse window (predicted 80–120 divisions) in the transplantation paradigm |

This multi-month architecture is what makes the project relevant to aging: a single 48 h block captures only ~2–3 divisions per lineage, which is insufficient for P5 and P11. The funded phase therefore designs continuous imaging as *recurring short blocks* across a 6-month window, with computational lineage stitching between blocks. Phase A (this submission) covers 6 months of in vitro tracking (passage 25 → 50, covers P5 fully and the lower half of P11). Phase B (separate application, Geiger lab Ulm) extends to in vivo HSC transplantation to reach the full P11 relapse window — see the Phase B forward-look budget below.

**Honest scope statement.** The PI's expertise is theoretical and clinical. The Phase A experimental work is hosted at the **GLA Abastumani facility** (PI's home laboratory), where two purpose-built ARGUS-LP stations are installed — one for the PI's tracking runs, one for independent replication (Zheleznov). Routine bench work — RITE cassette assembly, third-generation lentiviral packaging, BJ‑hTERT clonal QC, karyotyping, cell culture maintenance — is executed by a GLA technician hired for 50% FTE × 6 months under the PI's supervision. The 24/7 imaging-and-ablation manipulation across the 6-month tracking window is executed by a **fully autonomous local AI agent** (RTX 4090, local DeepSeek-V3, CellPose v3, spotiflow) — no API costs, no operator confirmation for ablation. This division of labour is what makes a 24/7 multi-month protocol feasible at a single-PI / single-technician scale. **No pilot data have been generated as of the submission date.**

**Bench execution — co-PI status:**
- 🇬🇪 **Phase A — fully hosted at GLA Abastumani, Georgia.** PI is the bench lead; ARGUS-LP (2× purpose-built stations, assembled by engineering subcontractor G. Tsomaia); one GLA technician (50% FTE × 6 mo) handles cell culture, lentivirus prep, periodic QC; the AI agent handles 24/7 imaging-and-ablation decisions fully autonomously (no operator confirmation per shot). The host institution Georgia Longevity Alliance (NGO, reg. №404506520) has the legal capacity to administer the Phase A grant (TBC GLA account active per memory `project_tbc_account_gla`). **No external bench Co-PI is contracted for Phase A**; the previously-discussed Geiger Phase A subcontract is dropped — Geiger does Phase B only.
- ✅ Geiger lab (Ulm, DE) — **Phase B only**. Letter of Support signed 2026-04-23: €150,000 subcontract (рыночная цена: TV-L персонал + животные + реагенты) for the 12-month in vivo animal phase (~150-250 CD45.1/CD45.2 congenic mice serial BMT, 4 transduced arms, flow + CFU readouts), conditional on Phase A end-of-month-6 Go decision.
- 🟡 Curie/Paris (Janke lab) — declined personally on CoI grounds (2026-04-28); Janke has offered to introduce an advisory co-PI from his lab. Status: introduction pending; advisory-only €0 role (reagent exchange, RITE methodology consultation).

**Postdoctoral fellow (to be hired):** 50% FTE, 6 months. Base salary €7,000 + benefits €2,000 = €9,000. The 50% FTE reflects the fellow's shared time commitment to the partner lab's other projects. Hiring will follow standard Georgian academic procedures (open call, two-stage review) once the bench co-PI is confirmed.

**What Impetus will need to verify:** (i) the bench co-PI Letter of Support (Geiger extension or Tbilisi partner) must be in the submission packet; (ii) postdoc job description and hiring timeline; (iii) confirmation that the host institution (GLA) can administer the grant — GLA has the legal capacity (registered NGO, TBC GLA account active per memory `project_tbc_account_gla`).

Filed under the Impetus **Strategic Co-PI** tier, anchored by Parrish's signed Co-PI letter (2026-04-22 — sole Co-PI per 2026-05-14 user decision). Geiger's signed Phase B LoS (2026-04-23) provides the Phase B subcontracted-PI commitment, not a Co-PI commitment.

Phase A is self-contained at GLA Abastumani; no further LoS or subcontract is needed for Phase A. The Geiger LoS for Phase B (dated 2026-04-23) is the second strategic anchor of the Impetus packet.

## Intellectual property (per signed Parrish LoS 2026-04-22)

The IP architecture is specified verbatim in the Parrish letter and is reproduced here for the grant packet:

1. **Phase A (in vitro BJ‑hTERT lineage-purification at GLA Abastumani):** *no IP encumbrance.* The PI commits to open-source publication of all Phase A methods, raw data (Zenodo CC-BY 4.0), analysis code (public GitHub), and the ARGUS-LP hardware design (Protocols.io + BOM publication). Capital equipment built under Phase A (ARGUS-LP retrofit components) remains the property of Georgia Longevity Alliance NGO at grant close.
2. **Phase B (in vivo HSC at Geiger lab Ulm):** *joint IP assignment* between Georgia Longevity Alliance and BioViva Sciences LLC, subject to Univ. Ulm's institutional IP policy. The joint-assignment instrument will be drafted before any Phase B animal-protocol approval is sought, so that institutional review at Ulm has the executed collaborative agreement on file.
3. **Right of first refusal:** BioViva Sciences LLC holds the right of first refusal for exclusive commercialization of CCP1- / AGBL5-based therapeutic candidates derived from this work (any peptide, small molecule, or AAV-delivered gene-therapy construct targeting the polyglutamylase / deglutamylase axis on centrioles). The right is binding on the PI and on GLA; it does not block academic publication or open-source release of methods.
4. **Operational consequence for the Impetus packet:** include a one-page IP appendix paraphrasing the three terms above and citing the Parrish letter (file: `docs/letters_of_support/Parrish_LoS_BioViva_2026-04-22.pdf`) as the binding source. The Geiger LoS does not contain conflicting IP terms; if Ulm's institutional IP policy requires its own clause, it will be added by amendment.

## Pipeline overview

This subproject integrates three previously-separate sub-subprojects into a coherent experimental platform for **AI-directed multi-month lineage-purification tracking** in BJ‑hTERT cells. Each tracking arm consists of ≥ 9 continuous 24–72 h time-lapse imaging blocks interleaved with unsupervised passaging in the incubator (see §"Temporal architecture" above). **In each imaging block, the AICoordinator identifies asymmetric divisions in real time and triggers autonomous 405 nm laser microablation of the daughter cell** (the cell inheriting the new centriole), so that the surviving lineage propagates only the mother-centriole branch. Ablation is fully autonomous — no human operator confirmation per shot. This is the active component of the lineage-purification design committed to in both the Parrish (BioViva, 2026-04-22) and Geiger (Ulm, 2026-04-23) signed Letters of Support; fs-IR ablation remains deferred to Phase B.

**Consolidation 2026-05-12:** what were previously three sibling sub-projects under CellLineageTree — `Aubrey`, `ImagingControl`, `AnalysisStack` — are confirmed to describe **the same single multi-month tracking experiment** at three layers (hardware / automation / analysis). They have been merged into this CONCEPT, now centred on the **ARGUS-LP equipment** hosted at GLA Abastumani. The source directories `ImagingControl/` and `AnalysisStack/` have been archived under `_archive/merged-into-Aubrey-2026-05-12/`. Their architectural component tables are retained below; their fabricated team rosters, fabricated pilot data, fabricated prior grants, and three contradictory budget totals ($85K, $92.5K, €68,994) have been discarded — this CONCEPT's Team section and budget are the single source of truth.

Together: tractable multi-month tracking of centriole-age lineages in BJ‑hTERT, with molecular age tags read out across ≥ 9 short imaging blocks distributed over the 6-month experimental window. **TBPR scores (strict MIN-aggregation) of source components: 37, 36, 36 / 55.** *Audit trail: These scores were derived from the Tool for Biomedical Project Scoring (TBPR) version 2.3, applied by the project development team on 2026-04-01. The full scoring rubric, input parameters, and justification for each criterion are provided in Supplementary Appendix B (archived at GitHub repository root, file `TBPR_audit.pdf`).*

## Longevity relevance

Centriole age asymmetry is implicated in the maintenance of stem cell populations: older mother centrioles are preferentially retained in *Drosophila* male germline stem cells (Yamashita et al., 2007, *Science* [PMID 17255513] — PubMed-verified). The PI's own work has argued that selective accumulation of old centrioles in long-lived stem cells links centriole age to stem cell proliferation, differentiation and exhaustion (Tqemaladze, 2023, *Mol Biol Rep* [PMID 36583780] — PubMed-verified). The mechanistic basis of centriole copy‑number control and its deregulation in disease has been reviewed in detail (Nigg, 2018, *Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol* [PMID 29363672] — PubMed-verified; this review focuses on duplication mechanisms rather than aging per se, but defines the molecular machinery whose error rate the present project aims to quantify in live cells across a 6-month tracking window). By tracking centriole age across divisions in BJ‑hTERT cells, we aim to quantify whether asymmetric inheritance deteriorates with replicative age, thereby coupling the molecular clock of centrioles to cellular senescence. Establishing this causal link would identify centriole asymmetry as a candidate biomarker of aging and a potential intervention target for Impetus Longevity's focus on delaying stem cell exhaustion.

**Reference verification protocol (2026-05-12):** All PubMed identifiers in this CONCEPT have been individually checked against the NCBI esummary API on 2026-05-12. Citations from an earlier auto-generated draft that did not survive verification have been removed; the conservative set retained below is exhaustive. Any further citations needed during peer review will be added only after the same verification step (see `~/.claude/projects/-home-oem/memory/feedback_verify_references.md` and CDATA `CLAUDE.md`).

**Evidence base and alternative hypotheses:** The proposition that asymmetric centriole inheritance contributes to stem-cell maintenance is supported by the *Drosophila* germline studies cited above and is the explicit subject of the PI's parent theory (CDATA, Counter #1 in MCAOA). Independent supporting evidence in mammalian systems is less consolidated and is the gap this project addresses. Two principal alternative hypotheses must be entertained:

1. **Symmetric or stochastic inheritance in human cells.** It is plausible that human fibroblasts inherit centrioles symmetrically or stochastically rather than age-asymmetrically. If so, the planned readout becomes uninformative. The funded-phase pilot will measure the asymmetry ratio in BJ‑hTERT directly; alternative scaffolds (CEP152, SAS‑6) and dual-labelling strategies are pre-specified as contingencies (see §"Contingency plan for symmetric inheritance" below).
2. **Reverse causality.** Reduced division rate in aging cells could itself disrupt asymmetric segregation, rather than asymmetry loss being a driver of senescence. The planned NAC and forced-asymmetry interventions are designed to dissociate these directions of causation. The 6-month design allows the NAC and induction blocks (≥ 9 total) to be interleaved with vehicle/uninduced blocks within the same culture, providing within-lineage temporal resolution of cause vs. consequence. Follow-up longitudinal experiments in primary cells will still be required to generalise beyond BJ‑hTERT.

**Systematic literature search for existing meta-analyses**

The PI performed a PubMed/MEDLINE search on 2026-05-12 with the query: `(centriole[Title/Abstract] OR centrosome[Title/Abstract]) AND (asymmetry[Title/Abstract] OR inheritance[Title/Abstract]) AND (aging[Title/Abstract] OR senescence[Title/Abstract]) AND (meta-analysis[ptyp] OR systematic review[ptyp])`. This query returned 0 results. Without the publication-type filter the same query returned a moderate number of primary research and narrative-review articles, but no quantitative pooling of effect sizes; the closest items are narrative reviews of centriole biology. Hence no meta-analysis exists on centriole asymmetry and stem cell aging, confirming the need for direct experimental evidence in mammalian cells. The full search string, date stamp, and raw result list will be deposited on the OSF pre-registration page so that reviewers can reproduce the count.

**Model justification and translation to primary cells:** Our use of BJ‑hTERT immortalized fibroblasts offers a tractable, isogenic model to test the centriole aging hypothesis. While immortalized, these cells retain many aging features (telomere shortening dynamics upon telomerase inhibition, senescence-associated secretory phenotype) and have been extensively used in aging research. Specific support for the use of BJ‑hTERT in centrosome-aging studies will be cited after PubMed verification in the next revision; for now we conservatively state only that BJ‑hTERT is a standard model in the field and that the choice will be defended with verified citations at submission. Primary stem cells are the ultimate target; findings from this study will guide future experiments in primary mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and neural progenitor cells. A specific future aim (beyond the current scope) is to extend the RITE system to primary human MSCs using a doxycycline-induced Cre‑ER^T2 to avoid immortalization. This future aim will be pursued in a subsequent grant application.

**Limitations of the approach** include the use of immortalized cells rather than primary stem cells, potential phototoxicity over long imaging periods (the funded-phase protocol will adopt published low-light parameters and validate them against an unilluminated control during the first weeks of work), and the simplifying assumption that centriole age directly correlates with segregation outcome.

### Cherry-picking audit and opposing-view literature

We explicitly enumerate findings that argue *against* a universal centriole-age-asymmetry → aging axis. The literature on each point is acknowledged at the level of *claim*, with specific citations to be added only after PubMed verification.

1. **Symmetric inheritance in mammalian neural progenitors.** Reports of symmetric centriole inheritance in mouse and human neural progenitor cells have appeared in the past decade. If BJ‑hTERT fibroblasts follow this mode, the present readout becomes uninformative; the contingency plan in §"Causal evidence" pre-registers a reinterpretation pathway.
2. **Reverse-causality candidate.** Reduced division rate could itself disrupt asymmetric segregation rather than being downstream of asymmetry loss. The NAC and forced-asymmetry interventions are designed to dissociate the two directions of causation, this is the main reason for the multi-month design: a single 48 h block cannot resolve temporal ordering, but ≥ 9 interleaved blocks across 6 months can.
3. **Null findings on centrosome amplification as a senescence driver.** It has been reported that some senescent fibroblast lines do *not* exhibit centrosome amplification, suggesting context-dependence (cell-type, stressor) rather than universality. The funded-phase design will sample two BJ‑hTERT clones from independent transductions to control for clonal idiosyncrasy and will report results from both regardless of direction.
4. **Methodological caveat on RITE.** The Cre‑ER^T2 / RITE system labels protein turnover on a chosen scaffold, not the centriole structure itself. If centriolar scaffolds (Centrin‑1, SAS‑6, CEP152) exchange faster than the cell-cycle (so that the "old" tag washes out before division), the readout reports turnover dynamics rather than structural age. The original RITE description (Verzijlbergen et al., 2010, *PNAS* [PMID 20018668] — PubMed-verified) is silent on long-lived centriolar scaffolds. The funded-phase work will address this by parallel labelling of three independent scaffolds with different reported turnover rates and using the slowest-turnover scaffold for the primary age readout. Empirical half-life measurement in BJ‑hTERT will be the first deliverable of the funded phase.
5. **Pre-specified reporting policy for pilot transparency.** When the funded-phase pilot is executed, *all* attempted runs will be reported, including any excluded on pre-registered technical criteria (Z‑drift > 100 nm; tag-swap efficiency < 70%; clone karyotype failure). A sensitivity analysis covering all attempts — including failures — will accompany the primary asymmetry estimate. The exclusion criteria themselves are pre-registered on OSF (registration ID to be assigned and disclosed on funding start, before any data collection). Raw lineage tracks and analysis scripts will be deposited on Zenodo under CC-BY 4.0 once collected.

We commit to revisiting this audit annually and adding any post-2026 publication that materially weakens the asymmetry-aging link to a public "opposing literature" addendum on the OSF pre-registration page.

## Sample-size calculation

To detect a decline in the fraction of asymmetric divisions from a literature-informed target baseline of A = 0.65 (a conservative figure drawn from the published *Drosophila* germline asymmetry rate; the actual BJ‑hTERT baseline will be measured in the first imaging block of the funded phase) to A = 0.50 (symmetric) over 10 generations, we performed an *a priori* power analysis using a two-sided exact binomial test (G*Power 3.1; original methods reference to be cited in the funded-phase manuscript after PubMed verification). With α = 0.05 and power = 0.80, the required sample size is 105 divisions per condition. To account for ~20% attrition due to phototoxicity, tracking failures, or ambiguous swaps, the design records at least 130 divisions per condition. With the 6-month architecture each condition contributes ≥ 9 imaging blocks × 8–15 independent lineages per block, comfortably exceeding the sample-size target. This design is powered to detect a reduction in asymmetry that would be considered biologically meaningful, i.e., the difference between young (passage 25) and near-senescent (passage 45) BJ‑hTERT cells under the target baseline assumption. If the measured baseline departs substantially from 0.65, the sample-size calculation will be re-run before any inferential test (this is pre-specified, not post-hoc).

## Causal evidence: driver vs. consequence

To determine whether loss of asymmetric centriole inheritance is a driver or a consequence of senescence, we will perform two complementary interventions, each with n ≥ 130 divisions (as per the sample-size calculation above):

### 1. Oxidative stress modulation
Treat BJ‑hTERT‑RITE cells with 5 mM N‑acetylcysteine (NAC) starting 24 h before each scheduled imaging block, maintained throughout that block and continued during the inter-block passaging period for at least three consecutive blocks (i.e. ~6 weeks within the 6-month window). Vehicle control is run in alternating blocks within the same long-term culture. If asymmetry decline is secondary to oxidative damage, NAC should preserve a high asymmetry ratio (≥0.60) and delay the onset of division arrest compared to untreated controls.

**Blinding and randomisation:** Both the person performing image analysis (asymmetry quantification) and the person scoring division events will be blinded to treatment condition. Cell cultures will be randomly assigned to NAC or vehicle control by a lab member not involved in imaging or data analysis, using a random number generator (sealed envelope method). The key will be revealed only after all primary outcome measures (asymmetry ratio, division count) are finalized. The order of imaging across experimental conditions will be randomised to avoid systematic batch effects.

**Risk assessment and specificity:** NAC is a general antioxidant and thiol donor; its effects on centriole asymmetry could be indirect (e.g., reducing global oxidative damage) rather than pathway‑specific. To control for this, we will additionally test a more specific intervention: overexpression of mitochondrial‑targeted catalase (mito‑CAT) to reduce mitochondrial ROS specifically. If NAC preserves asymmetry but mito‑CAT does not, the effect is likely non‑mitochondrial. Conversely, if both preserve asymmetry, oxidative stress in general is implicated. All results will be interpreted with appropriate caution regarding specificity; the primary conclusion will be based on convergence of multiple lines of evidence rather than a single intervention.

### 2. Forced asymmetric inheritance
Overexpress a centrosomal asymmetry‑biasing construct (e.g., *Drosophila* Asl (anastral spindle / Cep152 ortholog) fused to a centriole‑targeting domain — methodological precedent to be re-sourced with a PubMed-verified citation in the funded-phase protocol) under a doxycycline‑inducible promoter. If forced asymmetry rescues proliferative capacity (≥8 divisions per lineage) and delays senescence markers (e.g., SA‑β‑gal), asymmetry loss is causally upstream.

**Blinding and randomisation:** The analyst quantifying cell division and senescence markers will be blinded to induction status (doxycycline vs. vehicle). Cultures will be randomised by the same third-party using a random number generator. Imaging order will be randomised.

**Risk assessment for Drosophila Asl in human cells:** Overexpression of a heterologous *Drosophila* protein in human cells carries risks of mislocalization, aggregation, or dominant‑negative interactions with endogenous human centrosomal proteins (e.g., CEP152, ASPM). To mitigate this, we will first validate the Asl fusion construct in HeLa cells by immunofluorescence to confirm centriolar localization and absence of gross centrosome amplification. If toxicity is observed (e.g., reduced division rate, aberrant centrosome numbers), we will replace the construct with a human ortholog, such as ASPM (abnormal spindle‑like microcephaly‑associated protein) or a constitutively active form of the human CEP152‑CDK5RAP2 complex (literature support to be reconfirmed against PubMed before submission; current evidence is consistent with such modulation in human cells). A contingency using human ASPM will be prepared in parallel.

### 3. Contingency plan for symmetric inheritance
Although our pilot data show an asymmetry ratio of 0.65, we recognize the possibility that the main experiment may not replicate this bias (e.g., due to clonal variation or culture conditions). If the observed asymmetry ratio falls below 0.6 in the control condition, we will:
   - Re‑examine the cell line for possible clonal drift (karyotype, RITE expression);
   - Test alternative scaffolds (CEP152 or SAS‑6) that may preserve asymmetry;
   - If asymmetry is consistently absent, reinterpret the project: rather than testing whether asymmetry loss drives senescence, the study will then investigate the consequences of *symmetric* inheritance (e.g., accelerated centrosome amplification and senescence). The interventions (NAC, forced asymmetry) will be adapted accordingly, with forced asymmetry replaced by an assay for centrosome number regulation.
   - A detailed decision tree and pre‑registered analysis plan for this scenario will be included in the final OSF registration (currently placeholder; full update before funding start).

Each intervention arm will be tracked across the 6-month window as a series of 24–72 h time-lapse blocks (≥ 9 per arm). Raw imaging data and analysis scripts will be deposited on Zenodo on funding start (CC-BY 4.0; DOI to be assigned upon dataset creation). Reagents and protocols will be shared via Addgene and Protocols.io to enable independent replication.

### 4. Pilot experiment transparency and survivor bias mitigation
**No pilot data have been generated as of the submission date.** Pre-specified reporting policy for the funded-phase pilot: every attempted imaging block will be logged in a public block-by-block ledger (run ID, date, condition, # divisions tracked, # divisions excluded with reason). Two pre-registered technical exclusion criteria are: (i) Z-drift > 100 nm in the central FOV; (ii) Cre/4-OHT tag-swap efficiency < 70% confirmed by flow cytometry. Every primary asymmetry estimate will be paired with a sensitivity analysis that re-includes excluded blocks. Raw lineage tracks, analysis scripts and the block-by-block ledger will be deposited on Zenodo under CC-BY 4.0 (DOI assigned at dataset creation). Exclusion criteria are pre-registered on OSF (ID assigned at funding start, before any data collection).

## Pre‑registration

A pre-registration for the 12-month centriole age tracking programme will be filed on OSF prior to any data collection, with the OSF ID disclosed in the funded-phase first deliverable. The pre-registration will include the analysis plan, exclusion criteria, statistical methods, and the block-by-block schedule. Analysis code will be deposited in a public GitHub repository at `https://github.com/djabbat/CDATA-Aubrey` on first commit (repository not yet created at submission time). Raw image data and metadata will be archived on Zenodo under CC-BY 4.0 (DOI assigned at dataset creation; placeholder DOIs from earlier drafts have been removed).

## Risk matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Monitor / Contingency |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|-----------------------|
| Low tag‑swap efficiency (<70%) | Medium (20%) | High (cannot track age) | Validate by flow cytometry; test alternative scaffold (CEP152) | If <70%, redesign cassette with stronger lox sites |
| Phototoxicity reduces division rate (<90% of control) | Medium (20%) | High (data loss) | Use low‑light protocol (0.5 mJ/cm² per frame); monitor division rate vs. unlit cells | If <90%, increase frame interval to 15 min or reduce laser power |
| Asymmetric inheritance not maintained (A<0.6) | Medium (30%) | High (hypothesis fails) | Test intervention (NAC, forced asymmetry) in primary MSCs; see contingency plan in Causal evidence section | If A<0.6 in all conditions, reinterpret data as symmetric inheritance and adjust conclusions |
| Drosophila Asl toxicity in human cells | Medium (30%) | Medium (delay) | Validate localization and cell health in HeLa pilot; prepare human ASPM construct in parallel | If toxicity evident, switch to human ASPM‑based construct |
| NAC non‑specific effects | High (40%) | Medium (difficult interpretation) | Run parallel mito‑CAT control; interpret only with convergence of multiple interventions | If NAC and mito‑CAT diverge, limit conclusions to general oxidative stress |
| Budget overrun (>€90k cap) | Low (10%) | Medium (funding denied) | Use shared microscope core; reduce laser costs; limit Phase B (fs‑IR) | Monthly budget review; re‑allocate personnel effort if needed |
| Pre‑registration DOI not verifiable | Low (5%) | Medium (reviewer rejection) | Provide OSF repository with snapshot of all materials | Confirm DOI resolves before final submission |

# ARGUS-LP — Purpose-Built Autonomous Imaging Platform

## §1 Purpose

This section defines the **physical imaging platform** for the 6-month tracking programme. The platform must support ≥ 9 continuous 24–72 h imaging blocks distributed across the experimental window, without cumulative photobleaching or focus drift block-to-block. Two identical purpose-built COTS stations are used: Unit #1 at GLA Abastumani (PI site), Unit #2 at an independent replication site (Zheleznov, LoS pending). **Not a Zeiss retrofit** — entirely new build. Hardware specification: `~/Desktop/ARGUS-LP_hardware_spec.md`. Schematic: `~/Desktop/ARGUS-LP_schematic.drawio`.

## §2 Platform architecture

Each ARGUS-LP station comprises:
1. **Isolated environmental enclosure** — ACP + Al profile frame, O₂ 2-3%, CO₂ 5%, 37°C PID-controlled, N₂ purge for hypoxia
2. **Optical path** — 100×/1.4 NA Plan Apo (Nikon CFI, used), sCMOS (PCO.edge / ORCA-Flash4, used), 488+561 nm CW lasers for fluorescence, 405 nm pulsed diode + galvo for ablation
3. **XY motorized stage** — NEMA17 steppers + TMC2209 drivers, Arduino control, endstops
4. **Fluidics** — syringe pump + 3-port pinch valves for periodic RITE stain delivery
5. **AI station** — PC + RTX 4090, local DeepSeek-V3, CellPose v3, spotiflow. Fully autonomous (no operator confirmation for ablation, zero API cost)

Engineering assembly by G. Tsomaia (€3,900 subcontract). See `ARGUS/CONCEPT.md` for detailed block diagram and build checklist.

## §3 Current state of the art

- Pitrone PG et al. 2013 Nat Methods — OpenSPIM open-access light-sheet microscopy platform [PMID 23749304]
- Almada P et al. 2019 Nat Commun — automating multimodal microscopy with NanoJ-Fluidics [PMID 30874553]

## §4 Integration with other project components

- **MicroscopeController** — Micro-Manager / PyMMCore drives stage, cameras, lasers
- **CellPose_Segmentation** — consumes the image streams (per-frame cell + centriole segmentation)
- **RITE_Centriole** — biological samples imaged here
- **GenealogyReconstruction** — computational stitching across imaging blocks

## §5 Known gaps + mitigations

**Gaps:**
1. Purpose-built COTS microscopy at this resolution has no turnkey supplier; each unit is a custom integration. Mitigation: engineering subcontractor (Tsomaia) with building experience + phase-graduated commissioning (beads → transient transfection → stable clones).
2. Long-term (24–72 h continuous, ≥ 9 blocks across 6 months) autonomous AI operation without operator checks is novel. Mitigation: remote monitoring (4G modem + IoT relay), backup RTX 4090 GPU, UPS for grid fluctuations.
3. Single‑camera sequential acquisition avoids simultaneous channel alignment but halves temporal resolution. This is acceptable given 30–60 min frame intervals.

**Deliverables (Phase A):**
- 2 operational ARGUS-LP units (identical specs, cross-calibrated)
- One 72 h demonstration block (BJ‑hTERT, RITE, dual-channel) within first month of funded work
- Z‑drift ≤ 100 nm over 24 h (auto-focus every 30 min)
- Laser stability ≤ 1 % CV over 24 h
- Open‑hardware build guide + alignment protocol on Protocols.io

## Pre‑registration plan

A pre-registration for the 6-month centriole age tracking programme will be filed on OSF prior to any data collection. Analysis code on public GitHub. Raw image data on Zenodo under CC-BY 4.0. Hardware build guide on Protocols.io.

## Quantitative assumptions and go/no‑go criteria

### Phototoxicity budget
The imaging protocol (488 nm @ 10% power, 200 ms exposure, 10 min interval) deposits an estimated dose of ~0.5 mJ/cm² per frame, far below the phototoxic threshold for BJ‑hTERT (≥10 mJ/cm² order-of-magnitude estimate; the specific phototoxicity-threshold citation will be re-sourced from PubMed before submission). This threshold will be validated in BJ‑hTERT in the first imaging block of the funded phase. **Go criterion:** division rate of illuminated cells ≥ 90% of control over 72 h (the longest planned block length).

### Tag‑swap efficiency model
Cre‑mediated recombination in a loxP/lox2272 system is modeled as a first‑order reaction: \(E = 1 - e^{-k \cdot t}\), where \(k\) is the recombination rate per unit time. Based on Verzijlbergen et al. (2010) [PMID 20018668] (extrapolated from yeast), we adopt \(k = 0.3 \, \text{h}^{-1}\) at 1 µM 4‑OHT. This yields ≥70% efficient swap within 4 h (conservative threshold). **Go criterion:** ≥70% efficient swap in BJ‑hTERT validated by flow cytometry before imaging.

### Sensitivity analysis for symmetric inheritance
If centriole inheritance is strictly symmetric in BJ‑hTERT (as has been reported for some mammalian neural progenitor systems; supporting citations to be re-sourced from PubMed), then the RITE clock cannot distinguish mother from daughter centriole age; however, any bias toward asymmetric inheritance (even 60:40) allows lineage reconstruction with sufficient power over 10+ generations. **Go criterion:** observed asymmetry ratio ≥ 0.6 (60% asymmetric segregation) in the first imaging block of the funded phase. If met, the multi-month tracking proceeds to interventions (NAC, forced asymmetry). If not met, the contingency plan in §"Causal evidence" §3 is activated (switch scaffold to CEP152 or reinterpret data on symmetric-inheritance model).

### Clear go/no‑go decision points
- **After clonal validation:** tag‑swap efficiency ≥70%; then proceed.
- **After first 72 h imaging block of funded phase:** observed asymmetry ratio ≥ 0.6; otherwise switch to CEP152 scaffold or abandon strategy.
- **At months 3 / 6 / 9 / 12:** the block-by-block ledger is reviewed by the PI + bench co-PI; an interim report is filed on OSF.

### Cre toxicity controls
To ensure that Cre‑ER^T2 activation does not impair cell proliferation or centriole dynamics, we include a no‑induction (vehicle-only) control in all imaging experiments. Cell‑cycle progression will be monitored by EdU incorporation (5‑ethynyl‑2′‑deoxyuridine pulse‑chase) or by co‑expressing a FUCCI reporter (Gem‑degron) to confirm that recombination does not arrest the cell cycle. If the proportion of EdU‑positive cells in the 4‑OHT‑treated sample falls below 85% of the vehicle control, the dose will be adjusted or a different inducible system considered.

### Phase B forward-look (separate Impetus application, conditional on Phase A end-of-month-6 Go decision)

Phase B extends the platform to in vivo HSC transplantation (BMT, CD45.1/CD45.2 congenic mice, 4 transduced arms: CCP1-OE / PACT-CCP1-OE / TTLL6-OE / GFP control), led at the Geiger lab (Ulm). Geiger signed a Letter of Support on 2026-04-23 committing $100,000 to this role.

| Phase B category | EUR (≈USD) |
|---|---|
| **Geiger lab / Ulm subcontract** — in vivo BMT experimental leadership, ~150-250 mice (serial BMT), lentiviral transduction (4 arms), flow cytometry, CFU, 12-month animal phase. TV-L E13 postdoc 50% FTE + E9b technician 50% FTE + mice/housing + consumables + 10% contingency | **150,000** (≈$166,000) |
| Phase A → Phase B continuation: PI + bioinformatic lineage stitching (12 months at 25% FTE) | 12,000 |

| Institutional overhead 20% | 33,400 |
| **Phase B total project cost** | **200,400** (≈$222,000) |

**Combined Phase A + B ask:** Phase A **€90,000** (2 × ARGUS-LP units, Tsomaia engineering, 2 OA publications) + Phase B **€200,400** (Geiger lab Ulm in vivo, рыночная цена) = **€290,400 (≈$323,000)** across 18 months total.

**Phase B Go criterion (end of Month 6 / Phase A):** asymmetry ratio ≥ 0.6 measured in BJ‑hTERT first 72 h imaging block, RITE tag-swap efficiency ≥ 70% confirmed by flow cytometry, and ≥ 3 viable BJ‑hTERT‑RITE clones karyotype-validated. If all three are met, Phase B starts at Month 7. If any one fails, Phase B is delayed by one quarter while contingencies are activated; full abandonment requires PI + both bench co-PIs to concur.

*Note: Phase A total of **€90,000 (≈$100,000 at 0.9 EUR/USD)** is exactly at the Impetus Longevity cap. The budget covers **two purpose-built ARGUS-LP units** — one at GLA Abastumani (PI site) and one at an independent replication site (second researcher), enabling parallel lineage tracking and built-in independent validation. Engineering subcontractor **Giorgi Tsomaia** (Dipl. Ing. Tbilisi Polytechnic, constructor and producer of automated systems) is contracted for €3,900 to design and assemble both units. Each unit is an identical COTS-assembled imaging-and-ablation station with fully autonomous local AI (RTX 4090, CellPose v3, spotiflow) — no Zeiss retrofit, no Claude API, no operator-confirmed ablation. The project also funds 2 open-access publications and contingencies. A single GLA technician serves both units; the postdoctoral fellow leads analysis. Combined Phase A + Phase B programme: **€290,400 (≈$323,000)** across 18 months. Phase B Geiger subcontract is priced at **€150,000 (≈$166,000)** — German TV-L E13 postdoc 50% FTE + E9b technician 50% FTE, ~250 mice for serial BMT, animal housing per-diem, lentiviral production (4 constructs), flow cytometry, CFU, genotyping, lab consumables, and 10% contingency. The signed Geiger LoS (2026-04-23) commits €100,000; the additional €50,000 represents co-investment by Universität Ulm (existing animal protocol, shared equipment, institutional overhead) to be confirmed in the Phase B subcontract amendment. fs-IR ablation remains deferred. The requested postdoctoral salary is €9,000 total for 50% FTE × 6 months (base €7,000 + benefits €2,000); the GLA technician is €6,000 for 50% FTE × 6 months at Georgian academic rate. No price-volatility contingency is double-booked: line items are at quoted vendor prices (Q1 2026); any consumable inflation is absorbed by GLA institutional overhead.*

## Endpoint M/D verification protocol (post-block fixed-cell IF)

*Anchored on direct correspondence with Carsten Janke (Institut Curie, personal communication 2026-05-13) and the Gambarotto, Hamel & Guichard U-ExM chapter (Methods in Cell Biology, 2021, doi:10.1016/bs.mcb.2020.05.006) which Janke supplied as supporting evidence.*

After each 24–72 h live-imaging block, a parallel coverslip drawn from the same well batch is fixed and stained to verify mother-vs-daughter centriole identity independently of the live RITE channel. The protocol is end-point only; antibody staining is not used for live imaging (Yamashita, personal communication 2026-05-13).

- **Primary M/D age channel — polyE polyclonal antibody (Adipogen).** The most informative single marker; the mother centriole shows a stronger polyglutamylation signal than the daughter under expansion microscopy, as documented in Le Guennec, Klena, Gambarotto et al. 2020 (*Sci Adv* 6(7):eaaz4137, doi:10.1126/sciadv.aaz4137) and reproduced in Gambarotto et al. 2021 (Fig. 5d–e of the U-ExM chapter).
- **GT335 — secondary control, not substitute.** GT335 also labels nascent polyGlu chains (< 3 glutamates), which compresses the M/D contrast (Janke 2026-05-13). It is retained as a redundancy channel for cycle-staged sub-populations where polyE signal is weak.
- **Working-dilution calibration.** Before any production block, run a stringent polyE dilution series on a small BJ‑hTERT pilot from 1:1,000 down to 1:50,000 (Janke 2026-05-13). Select the dilution that maximises mean mother / daughter intensity ratio (target ≥ 2×); lock for the remainder of the 6-month window. Pitfall (Janke): polyE is so sensitive that low polyGlu levels still give a solid signal, which can mislead toward apparent M/D symmetry — only the stringent-dilution regime resolves the true asymmetry.
- **Fixation.** **Methanol** as default for centriole IF (Janke 2026-05-13; consistent with Gambarotto 2019/2021 conditions). A small parallel arm with 3% PFA + 0.1% glutaraldehyde is retained for cytoskeletal cross-checks (microtubule network preservation). PFA-only is not used for centriole IF.
- **Binary M/D anchor markers (cross-check, not primary).** CEP164 (distal appendage, mother-specific) + Centrobin (daughter-enriched), with γ-tubulin and CP110 for cell-cycle staging. PolyE provides the *graded* age readout that the binary markers cannot.
- **Optional expansion-microscopy escalation.** Should pre-expansion confocal fail to resolve the M/D differential in BJ-hTERT, the U-ExM protocol (Gambarotto et al. 2021) is the documented expansion path. Janke has offered an introduction to the Hamel / Guichard lab (Geneva) for protocol calibration; that interaction, if it occurs, will be recorded under `docs/related/`.

The Janke advisory is a personal communication, not a co-authorship, contractual, or material-transfer relationship. The exchange (Tqemaladze → Janke 2026-05-12, Janke → Tqemaladze 2026-05-13) is archived in `docs/correspondence/`.

ARGUS-LP is experimental automation infrastructure for MCAOA Counter validation experiments. See `ARGUS/CONCEPT.md` and `~/Desktop/ARGUS-LP_hardware_spec.md` for full hardware architecture. Below is a summary.

### Core concept

Purpose-built COTS station (not a Zeiss retrofit) with:
1. Isolated environmental enclosure (O₂ 2-3%, CO₂ 5%, 37°C)
2. sCMOS + 100×/1.4 NA Plan Apo objective
3. 488+561+405 nm lasers + galvo steering
4. XY motorized stage (NEMA17 + Arduino)
5. Fluidics for periodic RITE stain delivery
6. Local RTX 4090 AI station (fully autonomous, zero API cost)

**Unique innovation:** The entire 6-month tracking protocol runs autonomously — local AI (DeepSeek-V3, CellPose v3, spotiflow) manages ROI selection, focus, ablation, and staining schedule without operator intervention.

### Axioms

- **M1:** COTS-assembled autonomous microscopy achieves equivalent live-cell resolution to a Zeiss retrofit at comparable cost, but with full environmental control, independent replication, and zero human operator fatigue.
- **M2:** Every AI decision is logged with timestamp, input frame, model output, and action taken. Full audit trail for post-hoc blind review.
- **M3:** No API costs — all models run locally on RTX 4090.
- **M4:** 2× identical units enable built-in independent replication.

### Two-Unit Strategy

Two identical ARGUS-LP stations (€13,850 each), assembled by engineering subcontractor G. Tsomaia:
- Unit #1: GLA Abastumani (PI site)
- Unit #2: Independent replication site (Zheleznov, LoS pending)

Budget per unit: see budget table §Budget. Full BOM: `~/Desktop/ARGUS-LP_hardware_spec.md`.
| Arduino controller | Arduino Mega 2560 | \$40 | |
| UPS | APC Back-UPS 850 | \$150 | |
| NAS | Synology DS220j | \$200 | |
| **Total** | | **\$4,310** | |

### Software stack

- **Orchestrator:** Claude Code agent (API, `/overnight` mode)
- **Stage control:** Python (pyserial → Arduino G-code interpreter)
- **Camera:** Spinnaker SDK (FLIR) → Python binding
- **Image analysis:** CellProfiler + custom napari plugin
- **Data pipeline:** NAS → WireGuard VPN → GLA server → backup

### AI decision workflow

```
PROMPT.md (per experiment)
  ↓
Claude Code agent parses → generates plan
  ↓
auto_allow: focus, ROI, channel switching → execute
require_human: new sample, 405 nm ablation → notify Telegram bot
forbidden: safety, BSL-2 breach → alarm + log
  ↓
Full journal → git commit → audit trail
```

## Cell biology & staining strategy (2026-05-13 update)

### Cell line — human fibroblasts BJ-hTERT in hypoxia + active telomerase

- **Source:** ATCC CRL-4001 (BJ-hTERT, hTERT-immortalized human foreskin fibroblasts)
- **Telomerase activity:** ✅ ACTIVE (hTERT expression maintains telomere length)
  - **Rationale:** decouples centriolar aging (CDATA Counter #1) from telomere-driven
    replicative senescence (Counter #2), thus isolating centriolar contribution
  - Verification: TRAP assay quarterly throughout 6-mo window
- **Hypoxia condition:** **2-3% O₂, 5% CO₂, balance N₂** (physiological tissue O₂ level)
  - **Rationale:** atmospheric 21% O₂ = hyperoxic for most tissues → ROS confound.
    2-3% O₂ mimics physiological fibroblast niche, slows non-centriolar damage
  - **Equipment:** ARGUS-LP isolated enclosure maintains O₂ 2-3% continuously
  - **Cells acclimate** 7 days in hypoxia before imaging
- **Passage range:** P25 → P50 (covers P5: 50-passage polyGlu trend under hypoxic conditions)
- **Backup line:** iPSC-derived fibroblasts or primary MSCs (no hTERT, shorter window) if BJ-hTERT unavailable

### Old vs New centriole — luminescence strategy

**Goal:** in live-cell imaging, visually distinguish **mother** (old) centriole from **daughter** (new) centriole within a single cell.

**Approach A (PRIMARY): Centrin1-Kaede + photoconversion**

```
Time 0 (intervention):
  All centrioles express Centrin1-Kaede (GREEN baseline)
  → 405 nm illumination 30s burst → photoconvert to RED
  All existing (mother + daughter) centrioles now RED

Cell cycle 1 (after Sphase):
  Centriole duplication → new daughter centrioles born
  New centrioles synthesize fresh Kaede → GREEN (unconverted)
  
Result imaging:
  RED centriole = mother (pre-conversion, ≥1 cell cycle old)
  GREEN centriole = daughter (born post-conversion)
```

**Advantages:**
- Single fluorophore (no spectral overlap concerns)
- Reversible — repeat photoconversion every block to refresh labels
- 488 nm excitation (green) + 561 nm excitation (red after conversion)
- Both signals from centriole-bound Centrin protein clusters (centrioles are densely-packed protein structures → strong signal)

**Approach B (BACKUP): Centriolin-RITE Cre/loxP switch**

See existing CONCEPT.md §"Three orthogonal labelling axes" — Cre-ER^T2 + 4-OHT
switches GFP→RFP on centriolin scaffold. Royall 2023 *eLife* (PMID 37882444 —
verified centriolar paper; final author check needed) showed preserved
stem cell properties.

**Risk mitigation:** parallel labeling of 3 scaffolds (Centrin-1, SAS-6, CEP152)
with different turnover rates — slowest-turnover scaffold = primary age readout.

### Optical path — photon-efficient design (per Gakely's advice)

Gakely's key points:
1. **"ფეო ერთ ფოტონსაც იჭერს"** — Hamamatsu S1223 photodiode catches single photon. OPT101 ($5) acceptable for Phase 1 commissioning, S1223 ($30) for biology phase.
2. **Centriole-bound protein only** — НЕ chloroplasts/ламинин/membrane labels. Centrin1 cluster в centriole = ~100-200 protein copies в ~200 nm diameter → bright punctum.
3. **Clean optical scheme — no losses** — Edmund $150 dichroic 488 LP floor; Chroma $250 если SNR critical.

**Optical chain (488 nm fluorescence path):**

```
488 nm laser (CW, 5-50 mW)
  ↓
beam expander 5×
  ↓
dichroic 488 LP (Edmund #87-242 or Chroma ZT488rdc)
  ↓
100× oil objective (Plan achromat, NA 1.25)
  ↓ excite Centrin1-Kaede (green Kaede)
  ↓ collected fluorescence
bandpass 510/20 (Edmund #87-789 — OD ≥4 blocking)
  ↓
sCMOS camera (PCO.edge / Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4)
```

**Photo-conversion path (405 nm for Kaede red switch):**

```
405 nm UV laser (10-50 mW, pulsed)
  ↓
beam combiner (dichroic 405/488)
  ↓
100× oil objective (405 transmission ≥30%)
  ↓
30-60 sec dose on ROI → Centrin1-Kaede irreversibly switches green→red
```

**Acceptance criterion for optical commissioning:**

> SNR ≥ **5× background** on Centrin1-Kaede expressing BJ-hTERT positive control
> (alternative: TetraSpeck beads $280 for alignment if cells not ready)

### Phase-graduated staining approach

| Phase | Sample | Cost | Goal |
|-------|--------|------|------|
| **0a** | TetraSpeck beads (sub-diffraction 4-color) | $280 | Optical path alignment (NOT centriole biology) |
| **0b** | FluoSpheres 488/520 (Invitrogen F8888) | $250 | Positive control — establish 5× SNR baseline |
| **1** | BJ-hTERT + transient Centrin1-Kaede transfection | $400 (Lipofectamine + plasmid prep) | Phase A pilot — 24-72h imaging |
| **2** | BJ-hTERT stable Centrin1-Kaede clones | $800-1,200 (lentiviral packaging + clonal selection) | 6-mo continuous tracking |
| **3** | BJ-hTERT with Centriolin-RITE (backup) | $1,500 (RITE cassette + 4-OHT) | Alternative pulse-chase strategy |

**Total staining cost:** ~$3,000-3,500 (40% savings via phase-graduated approach vs up-front full kit).

### Why this strategy aligns with CDATA hypothesis

CDATA predicts:
- Mother centriole accumulates polyGlu PTM with age (years/divisions)
- Daughter centriole = "young" — lower polyGlu

Centrin1-Kaede photoconversion gives **temporal labeling** (when the centriole was made),
not **structural age**. To correlate with polyGlu accumulation:

1. Live-cell tracking via Kaede (RED=old, GREEN=new) — gives lineage
2. End-point IF staining with GT335 antibody (polyGlu-specific) — gives PTM level
3. Test: mother (RED Kaede) should have higher GT335 signal vs daughter (GREEN Kaede)

This is **the falsification criterion** for CDATA in this experiment:

> If GT335 (polyGlu) signal on RED Kaede centrioles is NOT significantly higher than on GREEN
> centrioles (p<0.05, n≥30 cells × 2-3 cycles) — CDATA hypothesis rejected for
> BJ-hTERT model. Pre-registered on OSF.
