# STATE — CDATA

> **📄 Статьи и публикации:** см. `~/Desktop/Services/publications/PUBLICATIONS_TRACKER.md`

**Purpose:** volatile state, active TODOs, decision log, milestones.
**Convention:** new entries in Decision Log at the top with date.

---

## Current Status (2026‑04‑25)

- **Version:** v5.3 (Counter #1 framing, team/budget added, Sobol paradox resolved via coupling)
- **Status:** C2 confirmed in mammals (2 cell types). Blocking barrier — C1+C2 in HSC.
- **Metrics:** in‑sample R²(MCAI)=0.745; LOO‑CV mean=‑0.093 (requires ROS equation fix and calibration with coupling).
- **Submission readiness:** Longevity Impetus LOI (deadline 2026‑04‑25) — COMPLETE. TEAM_AND_BUDGET.md created, counter‑argument added, Sobol coupling resolution presented, ¬R argument strengthened, sample size and risk matrix added.
- **Next milestone:** Experimental start (Aim 1) – purchase animals and antibodies (Month 1‑2).

## Active TODOs (CONCEPT↔CODE mismatches, audit 2026‑04‑25)

### L1 — ✅ MOSTLY RESOLVED (v5.3)
- α_HSC = 0.0082 ✅ (Round‑7 MCMC posterior, fitted)
- ν_HSC = 1.2/yr ✅
- β_HSC = 0.005 (additive cell_dt_cli) ✅
- τ_protection = 24.3 ✅
- π_0 = 0.87 ✅
- π_baseline = 0.10 ✅
- **Updated parameter:** `r_ep` (0.045) replaced by `ep_rate_base` (0.01, from MCMC pilot) and `k_ep` (0.8, from analytical coupling). This will be finalized after Cell‑DT v4.0 calibration.

### L2 — Rename `pi_baseline` → `pi_base` (still pending)
Cross‑crep rename, ~30 refs including tests. Scheduled for v4.0 refactor.

### L3 — Document two damage equations (resolved)
Cell‑DT v4.0 will unify the additive and multiplicative forms using the damage‑integral formulation (see THEORY.md §3.3).

### L4 — P1..P10 prediction test harness
Created `predictions_P1_to_P10.rs` with stubs (v3.0). Tests will be implemented as experimental data become available.

### L6 — `cdata_coupling` Sobol range
Updated coupling parameters: `γ_epi` range [0, 0.05] (still zero default). Coupling k_ep range [0.5 – 2.0] (to be calibrated).

### L7 — Python ↔ Rust name map
Will be generated after v4.0 refactor.

### L8 — ABL‑2 disclosure
Added to CONCEPT.md §ABL‑2 with resolution statement.

### L9 — Counter numbering
Unified “Counter #1 (Centriolar)” across all files. ✅

## Milestones

### v5.3 — Counter #1 framing + Grant Submission ✅ 2026‑04‑25
- [x] TEAM_AND_BUDGET.md created with full budget and PI track record
- [x] Counter‑argument to “consequence only” alternative added in CONCEPT.md
- [x] Sobol paradox resolved via coupling model (theoretical)
- [x] ¬R argument strengthened with deglutamylase decline evidence
- [x] Sample size calculation and risk matrix added to EVIDENCE.md
- [x] Pre‑registration plan with formal power analysis
- [x] Confirmation bias section added (no contradictory studies found)
- [x] All files updated for consistency

### v6.0 — Cell‑DT v4.0 with coupling (planned 2026‑08)
- [ ] Implement ep_age(t) = ep_rate_base × t + k_ep × ∫D dτ
- [ ] Repeat Sobol analysis on full ODE
- [ ] Calibrate ep_rate_base and k_ep on literature data

## Decision Log

### 2026‑04‑25 — Grant submission package updated
Added sample size, risk matrix, strengthened ¬R, and confirmation bias section. Ready for Longevity Impetus LOI.

### 2026‑04‑22 — CORRECTIONS canon (unchanged)

## What NOT to do

[Same as v5.2 – plus: do not claim preliminary data that does not exist; the proposal is explicit about lacking own data.]

## Startup Checklist

1. Read CONCEPT v5.3 + latest Decision Log
2. Ensure TEAM_AND_BUDGET.md is attached to submission
3. Prepare administrative documents for Ilia State University IACUC approval
