# CDATA — Memory

## History of Decisions

### 2024-01-15 — Project Initialization
- **Decision:** CDATA project created
- **Rationale:** Need for structuring and centralizing data across multiple sources; previous ad‑hoc methods caused inconsistencies and duplication.
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Use existing wiki (rejected due to lack of version control)
  - Maintain separate spreadsheets (rejected due to poor traceability)
- **Owner:** Project Manager

### 2024-02-10 — Technology Stack Selection
- **Decision:** Python + SQLite + Markdown
- **Rationale:** Lightweight, portable, easy to maintain. Python provides scripting flexibility, SQLite offers embedded storage without a server, and Markdown ensures human‑readable documentation.
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - PostgreSQL + React frontend (rejected – overkill for initial scope)
  - JSON files (rejected – harder to query and version)
- **Owner:** Lead Developer

## Dependencies
- Python 3.9 or higher
- SQLite3 (bundled with Python)
- Markdown parser (e.g., `markdown` library)
- Git for version control
- Access to source data repositories

## Exits
- All source data successfully migrated into SQLite database
- Markdown documentation generated for each data entity
- Validation scripts confirm data integrity
- Project handover documentation completed and reviewed by stakeholders
