## Dependencies
- Python 3.10+ with pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- R 4.2+ with Bioconductor packages (methylKit, minfi, ChAMP)
- External datasets: TCGA, GEO (GSE…), ENCODE
- Compute resources: 16 GB RAM, GPU optional for deep learning

## Outputs
- Preprocessed methylation data (beta values, M-values)
- Differential methylation analysis results (DMRs, DMPs)
- Epigenetic clock models (Horvath, Hannum, custom)
- Drift trajectory plots and statistical summaries
- Final report and interactive dashboard (Shiny/Streamlit)

## Goals & Tasks

### Goals
1. **Characterize epigenetic drift** across aging and disease cohorts.
2. **Identify key CpG sites** associated with accelerated drift.
3. **Build predictive models** for biological age and disease risk.
4. **Create reproducible pipeline** for drift analysis.
