# Telomere — Memory

## Project Overview
Telomere is a structured project management and long-term memory system designed to organize, prioritize, and track goals, tasks, decisions, and dependencies across multiple phases. The project emphasizes clarity, accountability, and continuous improvement. It serves as a single source of truth for all strategic and operational activities, enabling teams to execute efficiently and adapt to changing priorities. The name "Telomere" symbolizes the protective caps of chromosomes, reflecting the project's role in safeguarding and preserving organizational knowledge and progress.

## History of Decisions
### 2025-01-10 — Project Initialization
- **Decision:** Created the Telomere project.
- **Rationale:** Need for structured organization and long-term memory to reduce context switching and improve decision traceability.
- **Status:** Completed

### 2025-01-12 — Priority System Adoption
- **Decision:** Adopted P0/P1/P2 priority levels with explicit definitions: P0 = critical path blocker, P1 = important but not blocking, P2 = nice-to-have.
- **Rationale:** To clearly distinguish critical, important, and nice-to-have tasks and align team effort.
- **Status:** Completed

### 2025-01-15 — Deadline Standardization
- **Decision:** All tasks must have explicit deadlines; relative deadlines (e.g., "after Task X") are allowed only for dependent tasks.
- **Rationale:** Improve accountability and timeline tracking; reduce ambiguity.
- **Status:** Active

### 2025-02-01 — Tool Selection for Automation
- **Decision:** Use GitHub Actions for automated reminders and reporting; Slack for notifications.
- **Rationale:** Already in use, minimal learning curve, native integration with repository.
- **Status:** Active

### 2025-02-10 — Collaboration API Shortlist
- **Decision:** Evaluate Slack, Trello, and Notion APIs for integration; prioritize Trello due to team familiarity.
- **Rationale:** Most commonly used by the team; Slack already selected for notifications.
- **Status:** Pending (awaiting Phase 2 start)

### 2025-02-15 — Backup Frequency Decision
- **Decision:** Automated backups of decision log will run daily at 02:00 UTC.
- **Rationale:** Ensures no data loss while minimizing resource usage.
- **Status:** Active

### 2025-03-01 — User Feedback Methodology
- **Decision:** Use structured interviews and anonymous surveys for Phase 3 feedback.
- **Rationale:** Combines qualitative insights with quantitative data.
- **Status:** Pending (planned for Phase 3)

## Notes
- All decisions are logged with date, rationale, and status; logs are reviewed weekly.
- Priorities are reviewed quarterly during sprint planning.
- Deadlines are subject to adjustment based on project velocity; any change must be approved by Project Manager.
- Progress is tracked weekly via GitHub Projects; metrics include completion percentage, milestone adherence, and dependency lag.
- Communication: Daily standups at 09:30 UTC; weekly status report every Friday.
- Risk register: Maintained in separate document; top risks include dependency chain delays and tool integration complexity.
- Retrospectives: Held after each milestone; action items added to task list.
- This memory file is version-controlled and updated at least once per week.
