# CLAUDE.md — GLA Project Core

## Identity & naming (strict)

- **Canonical English name:** Georgia Longevity Alliance (GLA). **NEVER** use “Georgian Longevity Alliance”, “Longevity Georgia”, “Longevity Alliance Georgia”, or any Georgian transliteration in formal documents.
- **Georgian legal name:** კავშირი დღეგრძელობა (Art. 1.3 charter; NAPR record).
- **Legal form:** ა(ა)იპ (non-entrepreneurial non-commercial legal person).
- **ID:** 404506520.
- **Registered address:** 47 I. Javakhishvili St., Tbilisi 0170 (NOT 72 King David St.).
- **President/Chairman:** Jaba Tkemaladze, MD (Art. 4.10).

## Language rule

All responses in **Russian** (per global user rule). Use plain hyphens, never em-dashes.

## Writing tool rule

All writing through **DeepSeek API** (via `deepseek-r1` or `deepseek-chat`). Exception: Rust/Python integration code may use other tools.

## Source-of-truth precedence

1. NAPR extract (enreg.reestri.gov.ge, 2026-04-21)
2. Charter (2016, unamended — Art. 1–7)
3. CONCEPT.md (v2.0, 2026-05-03)
4. User-asserted memory (lowest priority)

## Fabrication prohibition

**NEVER** fabricate PMIDs, DOIs, addresses, dates, names, or contacts. If not in source materials, state “не указано” or “требуется верификация”.

## Boundary rules

- **NEVER** mix GLA with sister NGO **Sulkalmakhi** (separate banking, reporting, charter).
- **NEVER** touch `/Patients/` directory in any AIM context.
- **NEVER** reference “Longevity Party Georgia” or “Longevity Clinic, Inc.” as GLA entities.

## Git push rule

Public git push excludes all `.md` core files (CONCEPT.md, CLAUDE.md, charter docs). Only push README.md and code.

## Charter compliance flags

- Board quorum requires **all 5 members** (Art. 4.4) — any meeting without full attendance is invalid.
- No 2023 General Assembly election recorded — governance gap; regularise at 2026 GA.
- Address discrepancy: use charter address (47 Javakhishvili) for all official docs.
- Profit distribution prohibited (Art. 1.9, 6.6).

## Key dates

- Registration: 2016-01-12
- Next mandatory Board election: 2030-01-12
- EIC Pathfinder deadline: 2026-10-28
- DOAJ submission target: Q1 2027

## 0. Identity & legal status (verified)

| Field | Authoritative source |
|---|---|
| Georgian legal name | კავშირი დღეგრძელობა (Art. 1.3 of charter; NAPR record) |
| English canonical name | Georgia Longevity Alliance (Art. 1.3; NAPR record) |
| Legal form | Non-entrepreneurial (non-commercial) legal person — ა(ა)იპ (Art. 1.4; NAPR) |
| Identification code | 404506520 (NAPR enreg.reestri.gov.ge, 2026-04-21) |
| Registration date | 12 January 2016 (NAPR application B15240095 completed) |
| Legal address (charter) | ი. ჯავახიშვილის ქ. №47, თბილისი (Art. 1.5) |
| Registered address (NAPR) | Same as charter — 47 I. Javakhishvili St., Tbilisi 0170 |
| Contact email (charter) | djabbat@gmail.com (Art. 1.6) |
| President / Chairman | ჯაბა ტყემალაძე (Jaba Tkemaladze, MD) (Art. 4.10; NAPR) |
| Board members (charter) | 5 founders listed in Art. 2 |
| Charter in force | Original 2016 charter — no successful amendments (B18008130 terminated) |
| Status | Registered, active (NAPR) |
| ILA member | Yes (ecosystem context) |
| Website | longevity.ge (NAPR record; ecosystem context) |

**Address clarification:** The legacy reference “72 King David St., Tbilisi 0170” (from LinkedIn/Google) is **not** the registered legal address. All official communications, grant applications, and contracts *must* use the charter/NAPR address: **47 I. Javakhishvili St., Tbilisi 0170**. A formal address-change registration should be considered before the 2030 Board renewal (See Section 3).

## 1. Mission & charter alignment (Art. 1.8 ↔ today's activity)

**Charter Art. 1.8** defines four objectives. The 2026–2031 mission operationalises each:

| Charter objective | Current manifestation (2026) |
|---|---|
| **1.8.1** Support, advancement and assistance for human rejuvenation and life-extension | Host Institution for EIC Pathfinder Challenges 2026; research umbrella for CDATA, MCAOA, FCLC, BioSense, Ze Theory, Ontogenesis, HAP, Aqtivirebuli/Korkoti. |
| **1.8.2** Engaging people in life-extension activities | Public outreach via longevity.ge; collaboration with sister NGO Sulkalmakhi for local workshops; open-access publishing. |
| **1.8.3** Helping people with employment in line with their interests | Not yet operationalised as a standalone programme — to be developed in Pillar 2.4 (community & networking). |
| **1.8.4** Searching and establishing contacts with other longevity organisations in Georgia and abroad | ILA node; co-PI links with Ulm, Curie, UPF, COSIC/KU Leuven, BioViva; EIC consortium building. |

**Mission statement (derived from Art. 1.8):**  
*To advance human rejuvenation and life-extension science through international consortiums, diamond-OA publishing, theoretical development, and public engagement, all within the legal framework of a Georgian non-commercial legal entity.*

All auxiliary economic activity (Art. 1.9) shall serve this mission; profit distribution remains prohibited (Art. 1.9, 6.6).

---

## 2. Strategic pillars (5)

### 2.1 International longevity science consortium (EIC, Impetus, Horizon Europe)

- **Host Institution for EIC Pathfinder Challenges 2026** “Biotechnology for Healthy Ageing” (deadline 2026-10-28, €4M ceiling, TRL3-4). GLA is the legal applicant and coordinating entity.
- **Longevity Impetus Grants** — GLA as applicant entity for small pilot grants.
- **Horizon Europe** (Cluster 1, Missions) — future partnership tracks (2027–2029).
- **Co-PI network** (confirmed/in-progress 2026–05): Geiger (Ulm), Janke (Curie), Gonzalez Ballester (UPF), COSIC/Preneel (KU Leuven), Parrish (BioViva).
- **Charter basis:** Art. 1.8.1 (rejuvenation), Art. 1.8.4 (international contacts), Art. 4.5.1 (organisational development strategy).

### 2.2 Diamond-OA publishing (Annals of Rejuvenation Science + Longevity Horizons)

- **Annals of Rejuvenation Science** — e-ISSN 3088-439X, diamond OA, 4/5 Editorial Board confirmed. DOAJ submission Q1 2027. First issue WIP.
- **Longevity Horizons** (longevity.ge) — second OJS journal for broader longevity content.
- **Funding model — Vekua Club funder (зафиксировано 2026-05-06):** publication costs covered by the Vekua Club, so **no APC for any author** in either journal. This is what makes the diamond-OA model sustainable; it is NOT subsidised through GLA general funds.
- **Chichinadze Memorial Prize** (единый, student-only): a 3-tier annual prize (tier 1 / tier 2 / tier 3) for the best graduate-level papers published in either journal. Named in memory of Konstantine (Kote) Chichinadze. Funded separately from operations (donor-restricted line; see §2.5).
- **Charter basis:** Art. 1.8.1 (advancement), Art. 1.9 (auxiliary economic activity — page charges? no, diamond OA means no author fees; revenue from supplementary services or institutional memberships allowed as long as profit not distributed). Art. 4.5.1 (organisational strategy).

### 2.3 Theory & evidence — three Scientific Pillars (TF / ISE / IR)

The theory-and-evidence portfolio is organised into **three pillars** so that every active subproject can be traced to a methodological role:

- **TF — Theoretical Foundation.** Core hypotheses and conceptual frameworks. Lead artefact: **Centriolar Damage Theory (CDATA)** + its umbrella **MCAOA** (Multi-Counter Architecture of Organismal Aging, submitted to eLife since 2026-04-30).
- **ISE — In-Silico Experimentation.** Computational simulation, modelling, and theoretical validation. Lead artefacts: **Ze Theory** (predictive coding model), **CDATA Rust simulator**, **Ontogenesis simulator**, **HAP** computational pipeline.
- **IR — In-Real (empirical) Research.** Wet-lab and field-data validation. Lead artefacts: **BioSense** (federated clinical learning), **FCLC** (consortium proposal, server-resident), **Aqtivirebuli-Korkoti** (heritage-anchored nutrition, PNAS 2026 anchor).

Subprojects move along TF → ISE → IR as they mature. New theory enters at TF; only when ISE simulation supports it does it justify IR experimental investment.

- **Charter basis:** Art. 1.8.1 (support and advancement). No charter restriction on theoretical research.

### 2.4 Community & networking (ILA node, sister-NGO link, public engagement)

- **ILA node** — maintain membership and active participation.
- **Sister NGO Sulkalmakhi** — local civic/cultural/ecology projects (see Section 8 for boundary rules).
- **Public engagement** — longevity.ge website; social media; local workshops (via Sulkalmakhi).
- **Employment help (Art. 1.8.3)** — to be operationalised as a mentorship/career programme for Georgian scientists in longevity (target: 2027).
- **Charter basis:** Art. 1.8.2 (engagement), 1.8.3 (employment help), 1.8.4 (contacts).

### 2.5 Sustainability & auxiliary economic activity (Art. 1.9-compliant revenue lines)

Art. 1.9 permits auxiliary entrepreneurial activity provided:
- Profit serves the organisation's objectives (rejuvenation/life-extension).
- Profit **not** distributed to founders, members, donors, or officers.
- Asset alienation allowed only if it serves activity, organisational development, objectives, or charitable purposes.

**Permitted revenue models:**
- Consultancy fees (longevity science strategy for external entities) — limited, non-core.
- Institutional memberships for journal (Annals).
- Grant overhead (if allowed by funder; must be reinvested).
- Conference organisation (registration fees).
- Sale of non-exclusive licenses for research tools (e.g., assays, datasets) — only if proceeds flow back to mission.
- **Donations** (longevity.ge/#donate landing) — five channels documented:
  1. **PayPal** — active (linked to GLA banking).
  2. **TBC Bank** (GE) — placeholder; activation pending compliance with TBC's NGO requirements (см. memory `project_tbc_account_gla`).
  3. **Crypto** — placeholder; activation depends on Georgian regulatory clarity for NGO crypto receipts.
  4. **GitHub Sponsors** — to be reverified (currently routed to maintainer's personal account, not GLA legal entity; needs migration).
  5. **Email-led donor outreach** — direct ask via the contact form on longevity.ge/#donate.
  Donations are unrestricted unless donor specifies (the Chichinadze Memorial Prize is the only restricted line currently advertised).
- **Vekua Club funder** — separate revenue stream restricted to journal publication costs (covers OJS/DOI/operational APC-equivalent so authors pay nothing). Not commingled with GLA general funds.

**Prohibited:** Any distribution of surplus to individuals; any commercial activity that does not serve chartered objectives.

---

## 3. Governance roadmap (Art. 3–4 obligations)

**3.1 General Assembly (Art. 3)**
- Convened ≥ 1× per year (Art. 3.1).
- Quorum: 1/3 of members (Art. 3.4).
- Powers: elect Board, approve Board's annual reports, decide on reorganisation/liquidation (Art. 3.2).
- Chair: President (Chairman of Society) or ad-hoc chair (Art. 3.5).

**3.2 Board (Art. 4)**
- 5 members, 7-year term (Art. 4.1). Current Board members = 5 founders (Art. 4.9).
- Quorum: all members must attend (Art. 4.4). This is a **strict requirement** — any meeting without full attendance is invalid.
- Decision by majority vote (Art. 4.2). Chairman elected by > half for 7-year term (Art. 4.6).
- Chairman reports quarterly to Board (Art. 4.5.3, 4.8).

**3.3 Mandatory re-election cycles**
- **First re-election due:** 2023-01-12 (7 years from registration). **No record of a General Assembly election in 2023.** This is a compliance risk. If not held, the current Board is technically *de facto* continuing but may be challenged. **Action:** Regularise via retroactive ratification at next General Assembly (see Section 6).
- **Second re-election due:** 2030-01-12. Must hold General Assembly with proper quorum before this date.

**3.4 Address discrepancy (Art. 1.5 vs. NAPR)**
- Charter address (47 Javakhishvili) is the legal address. The NAPR record shows the same. The 72 King David St. address used on LinkedIn/legacy docs is inconsistent. **Action:** File a data-change registration with NAPR to update the address to the correct street if necessary, or formally adopt the charter address in all documentation. Note: the previous data-change attempt (B18008130) was terminated — a new application is needed.

**3.5 Annual General Assembly 2026**
- Must be held before end of 2026. Agenda: elect Board for 2026-2033 term (if 2023 election was missed, combine ratification of existing Board + new election); approve annual report; set strategy.

**3.6 Quarterly Chairman reports**
- Art. 4.8 requires quarterly reports to Board. Ensure written reports are archived.

## 5. Risk register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| No 2023 General Assembly held – governance gap | High | Medium | Ratify at 2026 GA; adopt resolution confirming continuity. |
| EIC Pathfinder failed | Medium | High | Diversify to Horizon Europe, Impetus, private foundations. |
| Editorial Board loss | Low | High (journal) | Maintain pool of 5+ editorial board members; recruit backups. |
| Charter amendment needed (e.g., for new objectives) | Low | Medium | Requires General Assembly with 2/3 majority (Art. 6.2). Unlikely needed – Art. 1.8 is broad. |
| Address inconsistency legal challenge | Medium | Low | Address correction filing (Section 3.4). |
| Quorum failure at Board meetings (Art. 4.4 requires all 5) | Medium | High (paralysis) | Schedule meetings well in advance; virtual attendance allowed? Charter silent – interpret flexibly but document. |
| Profit-distribution accusation | Low | Very High (dissolution) | Strict compliance with Art. 1.9, 6.6; annual audit. |
| Sister NGO Sulkalmakhi funds confusion | Medium | Medium | Clear MoU (Section 8). |

---

## 6. 12-month operational plan (2026-05 → 2027-05)

| Period | Actions |
|---|---|
| May–Jun 2026 | 1. File NAPR address correction (47 Javakhishvili). 2. Convene Board meeting: approve concept, set EIC preparation team. 3. Confirm remaining Annals Editorial Board member. |
| Jul–Sep 2026 | 1. Finalise EIC Pathfinder proposal text, secure all co-PI letters. 2. Hold General Assembly (ratify Board, approve annual report 2025, adopt governance regularisation). 3. Begin address correction registration (if not done). |
| Oct 2026 | Submit EIC Pathfinder (deadline 2026-10-28). |
| Oct–Dec 2026 | 1. Publish Annals first issue. 2. Establish employment-help programme framework. 3. Draft DOAJ application for Annals. |
| Jan–Mar 2027 | 1. Submit DOAJ application. 2. First quarterly report to Board (2027 Q1). 3. Impetus grant evaluation (if applicable). |
| Apr–May 2027 | 1. Prepare Horizon Europe call analysis. 2. Mid-year strategy review with Board. 3. Public launch of employment-help pilot (Art. 1.8.3). |

---

## 7. Succession & continuity (charter has 5 board members for resilience)

- **Board size:** 5 members (Art. 4.1) — sufficient for continuity. Should any member resign, the remaining 4 can still meet (quorum requires all 5 — Art. 4.4 is all, not majority). This is a vulnerability. **Interpretation note:** If a member resigns, the Board cannot meet until replacement is elected by General Assembly. Charter does not provide for interim replacement by Board co-optation. Therefore, **ensure all 5 are committed to serve full term or until successor appointed.** Consider a charter amendment to allow co-optation (requires 2/3 GA vote — Art. 6.2).
- **Chairman succession:** Chairman elected by Board for 7 years (Art. 4.6). If Chairman resigns, Board elects new Chairman from its members.
- **General Assembly mandatory:** To replace any Board member, must call GA with quorum (1/3 of members). Since the 5 founders are the only members currently? Membership is open (Art. 5.1) — Board can admit new members, which increases the pool for GA quorum.
- **Emergency plan:** Maintain a list of 3 candidate members (non-founders) who can be admitted by Board (Art. 5.1) to broaden GA base.

# Annals of Rejuvenation Science — CONCEPT

**Canonical journal name (2026-04-26+):** Annals of Rejuvenation Science
**e-ISSN:** **3088-439X**
**URL:** <https://longevity.ge/rescience/>
**Platform:** OJS 3.5.0.3
**Crossref member:** 55174
**Publisher:** Georgia Longevity Alliance (Reg. №404506520)
**Editor-in-Chief:** Jaba Tkemaladze, MD
**Started:** 2026-04-26 (publication setup)
**Target:** DOAJ submission Q1 2027

## Identity history

Renames during setup phase (do NOT use historical variants):
- ❌ "Journal of Centriolar Aging and Longevity (JCAL)" — early working name
- ❌ "Georgian Longevity Research (GLR)" — alternative considered
- ❌ "CDATA Journal of Cellular Aging" — alternative considered
- ✅ **Annals of Rejuvenation Science** — final, ISSN-registered

## Scope

Molecular and cellular mechanisms of aging-related dysfunction, centriologenesis,
centrosome biology, regenerative medicine, healthspan-extending therapies. Strong
overlap with CDATA (Centriolar Damage And) theory umbrella + MCAOA (Multi-Counter
Architecture of Organismal Aging).

## Twin-journal split (canonical strategy 2026-04-26)

GLA hosts **two journals**, separated by selectivity vs inclusivity:

| | Annals of Rejuvenation Science | Longevity Horizon |
|---|---|---|
| Selectivity | high (DOAJ-bound, peer review-strict) | broader, inclusive |
| Reject rate target | ≥40% | ≥10% |
| Use case | flagship CDATA / MCAOA papers | early-career, niche, conference |

**Don't trim Longevity Horizon to be like Annals** — they exist in tension on purpose.

## Editorial Board status (2026-04-30)

Target: 3-5 international editors before DOAJ submission. **Currently 4/5 confirmed.**

| # | Name | Affiliation | Consented | Bio-approved |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Eric Klien | Lifeboat Foundation | ✅ 2026-04-26 | ✅ |
| 2 | Liz Parrish | BioViva CEO | ✅ 2026-04-28 (provisional) | ⚠ pending |
| 3 | Alexey Moskalev | Petrovsky RRCS, Moscow | ✅ 2026-04-29 | bio sent |
| 4 | Aubrey de Grey | LEV Foundation | ✅ 2026-04-30 00:45 | bio not yet sent |
| 5 | TBD | TBD | — | — |

Need 1 more confirmed before Jan 2027 DOAJ submission for safety margin.

## Outreach Waves

- **Wave 1 (2026-04-28):** 17 author/editor invitations sent. Status check 2026-05-03 (today) via cloud routine `trig_01WSqXC8HXMP9qnJ83sq8x1Q`. Soft-pings sent to silent invitees by user 2026-05-03.
- **Wave 2 (2026-04-29):** additional editor invitations.

## DOAJ readiness — 2026-04-26 audit findings

3 critical blockers + 10 serious issues identified. **9/13 FIXED.** Prognosis 5% → 80% on DOAJ acceptance after step-fixes. Optimal submission window: **January 2027** (12 months past start meets DOAJ tenure rule).

# UPGRADE.md — Georgia Longevity Alliance Infrastructure Backlog

**Status:** Active | **Priority:** Ordered (1 = highest) | **Last updated:** 2026-05-03

---

## Priority 1 — Governance & Legal Compliance (charter obligations)

- [ ] **1.1** Hold General Assembly before 2026-12-31 to ratify Board continuity (Art. 3.1 — no record of 2023 election; governance gap must be regularised)
- [ ] **1.2** File NAPR address correction to 47 I. Javakhishvili St. (Art. 1.5 — legacy 72 King David St. is inconsistent with charter; new application needed since B18008130 was terminated)
- [ ] **1.3** Establish quarterly Chairman → Board written reporting routine (Art. 4.5.3, 4.8 — currently no documented quarterly reports)
- [ ] **1.4** Verify quorum compliance for all Board meetings (Art. 4.4 — requires all 5 members; any meeting without full attendance is invalid)
- [ ] **1.5** Draft charter amendment allowing Board co-optation for interim vacancies (Art. 4.1 — resignation of one member paralyses Board; amendment needs 2/3 GA vote per Art. 6.2)
- [ ] **1.6** Prepare bilingual GE/EN charter version for international funders (Art. 1–7 — EIC, Horizon Europe, Impetus require English legal documents)
- [ ] **1.7** Audit membership list and admit 2-3 non-founder members to broaden GA quorum pool (Art. 5.1 — current GA quorum depends on 5 founders only; risk if one is unavailable)

## Priority 2 — Grant & Financial Infrastructure

- [ ] **2.1** Engage audit firm for grant due-diligence and annual financial statements (Art. 1.9 — EIC Pathfinder €4M requires audited accounts; no auditor on record)
- [ ] **2.2** Set up separate grant bank account for EIC Pathfinder funds (Art. 1.9 — auxiliary economic activity must be traceable; prevents profit-distribution accusations)
- [ ] **2.3** Draft EIC Pathfinder proposal skeleton with all co-PI letters template (deadline 2026-10-28 — 5 months lead time; Geiger, Janke, Gonzalez Ballester, COSIC, Parrish confirmed)
- [ ] **2.4** Create overhead cost policy compliant with Art. 1.9 (grant overhead must be reinvested in mission; no distribution to founders/officers)
- [ ] **2.5** Register GLA in Horizon Europe Participant Portal (PIC number needed — not yet obtained; required for 2027–2029 proposals)

## Priority 3 — Publishing & Research Operations

- [ ] **3.1** Bring DOAJ application docs to Q1-2027-ready state (Annals of Rejuvenation Science — e-ISSN 3088-439X; editorial policies, peer review workflow, copyright license must be finalised)
- [ ] **3.2** Confirm 5th Editorial Board member for Annals (4/5 confirmed; gap blocks first issue publication)
- [ ] **3.3** Publish Annals first issue by Q4 2026 (Art. 1.8.1 — advancement of rejuvenation science; milestone for EIC credibility)
- [ ] **3.4** Archive all research subproject charters (CDATA, MCAOA, FCLC, BioSense, Ze, Aqtivirebuli) in GLA docs/ folder (current status: scattered across server; no central repository)

## Priority 4 — Institutional Documentation & Transparency

- [ ] **4.1** Deposit original charter PDF in statute/ folder (charter_2016.djvu exists but PDF not yet extracted; NAPR scan available)
- [ ] **4.2** Create public-facing governance page on longevity.ge (Art. 3–4 — Board members, charter summary, annual reports; required for EIC transparency)
- [ ] **4.3** Draft MoU with sister NGO Sulkalmakhi defining financial and operational boundaries (Section 8 of CONCEPT — prevents fund confusion; required for grant audits)
- [ ] **4.4** Establish Board minutes archive (Art. 4.2 — all decisions must be recorded; no central repository exists)
- [ ] **4.5** Create annual report template for 2025 (retroactive) and 2026 (Art. 3.2 — Board must approve annual reports; none on file)

## Priority 5 — Sustainability & Risk Mitigation

- [ ] **5.1** Develop non-grant revenue model (Art. 1.9 — consultancy, institutional memberships, conference fees; target ≥10% of budget by 2030)
- [ ] **5.2** Recruit 2 backup Editorial Board members for Annals (risk: loss of one member delays journal; maintain pool of 5+)
- [ ] **5.3** Draft emergency succession plan for Chairman (Art. 4.6 — 7-year term; if Jaba Tkemaladze resigns, Board must elect replacement; no interim provision)
- [ ] **5.4** Register GLA in Georgian Tax Authority as non-commercial entity (Art. 1.4 — required for grant overhead exemption; status unknown)
- [ ] **5.5** Conduct compliance audit of all past profit-distribution (Art. 1.9, 6.6 — zero-tolerance; review all transactions since 2016)

- **Art. 1.9:** Auxiliary entrepreneurial activity allowed; profit must serve objectives; **profit distribution to founders/members/donors/officers prohibited**.
- **Art. 3.4:** General Assembly quorum = 1/3 of members.
- **Art. 4.1:** Board = 5 members, 7-year term.
- **Art. 4.4:** Board quorum = **all 5 members must attend** (strict — no meeting without full attendance).
- **Art. 4.6:** Chairman elected by > half of Board for 7-year term.
- **Art. 4.8:** Chairman reports quarterly to Board.
- **Art. 6.2:** Liquidation/reorganisation requires 2/3 General Assembly majority.
- **Art. 6.6:** Distribution of residual property to founders/members/officers prohibited.

### 1.3 Governance compliance status (2026-05)

- **First Board re-election due:** 2023-01-12 — **no record of General Assembly held**. Compliance risk; must be regularised at 2026 General Assembly.
- **Second re-election due:** 2030-01-12.
- **Address discrepancy:** Legacy “72 King David St.” (LinkedIn) ≠ charter address (47 Javakhishvili). File NAPR address correction by 2026-09-30.
- **Quarterly reports:** Art. 4.8 requires written reports to Board — ensure archive exists.

### 1.4 Tax & audit implications (Georgian NCJP)

- **Tax-exempt status:** Georgian NCJPs are exempt from profit tax on income used for chartered objectives (per Georgian Tax Code, Art. 98). Must file annual tax return (Form 1) with Revenue Service.
- **VAT:** If annual turnover exceeds GEL 100,000 (approx. EUR 30,000), must register for VAT. Grant income may be VAT-exempt if properly structured.
- **Audit:** Not mandatory for NCJPs unless required by funder (EIC, Horizon Europe typically require annual audit for grants > EUR 500,000). GLA should maintain audited accounts from 2026 onward.
- **Profit-distribution ban:** Art. 1.9 and 6.6 — any surplus must be reinvested in chartered objectives. Violation risks dissolution (Art. 6.6).
