# Review of EpigeneticDrift

## Verdict
**REJECT**

## Scores (1–5)
- **Premise:** 4
- **Method:** 4
- **Evidence:** 3
- **Falsifiability:** 5
- **Deliv.:** 3 (technical architecture is promising, but pre‑registration and consortium still placeholder‑heavy)
- **Novelty:** 4
- **Risk:** 3 (matrix present, but does not account for fabricated references)
- **RefIntegrity:** 1 (one lethal fabrication)

## Checklist (✓/✗)

| # | Condition | Status | Explanation |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Operationalised falsifiability (numeric thresholds)** | ✓ | All tests list numeric decision rules: β₄ 95% CI ≠ 0, α₄ d≥0.3, coupling f²=0.15, |r|>0.3 p<0.01, power ≥0.80. |
| 2 | **Pre‑registration plan (OSF placeholder + date)** | ✓ | https://osf.io/TBD, planned 2026‑09‑01. Placeholder in pre‑reg plan is acceptable (rule 8 allows it). |
| 3 | **Sample size calc (power analysis)** | ✓ | Two calculations provided: t‑test N=64/group (Δ=0.2, α=0.05, power=0.80) and regression N=92 (f²=0.15). Formula and software (G*Power) stated. |
| 4 | **Risk matrix ≥5 rows** | ✓ | 5 rows: probability × impact × mitigation. Real risks (ABL‑2 confound, β/α separation, universal D₄, coupling measurability, tissue diversity). |
| 5 | **Limitations section** | ✓ | 5 honest limitations (causality, reversibility, layer inconsistency, tissue specificity, measurement noise). |
| 6 | **Consortium / collaboration plan** | ✓ | Three groups listed with roles (PI theoretical, Horvath clocks, Brunet experiments). Placeholder names acceptable at this stage. |
| 7 | **Reference reality + match** | **✗** | **LETHAL FAILURE.** PMID 41289991 (Arif et al. 2025) does **not** resolve in PubMed/Crossref – it is a fabricated identifier. Per rule: *“Невалидный идентификатор = автоматический REJECT компонента.”* All other checked references are real (see audit below). |
| 8 | **No fabrication markers** | **✗** | The fabricated PMID 41289991 is a strong fabrication marker. |
| 9 | **Internal consistency core docs** | ✓ | THEORY, EVIDENCE, PARAMETERS, OPEN_PROBLEMS, DESIGN logically coherent; no contradictions between core files. Cancelled MCAOA Test 2 is properly struck‑through. |

## Top 5 critical fixes (if not REJECT – for documentation only)

> Because the verdict is REJECT due to a fabricated PMID, a revision path would require:

1. **`CONCEPT.md` (References, line 2):** Remove or replace PMID 41289991 with a real, verifiable source. Justify the claim “Reversing lysosomal dysfunction restores youthful state in aged HSCs” with an actual publication or remove the claim.
2. **`CONCEPT.md` (Falsifiability section):** The struck‑through MCAOA Test 2 should be completely removed, not just struck‑through, to avoid confusion.
3. **`OPEN_PROBLEMS.md`:** Replace all “OSF ID pending” with a concrete placeholder (e.g., `https://osf.io/abcde`) to satisfy pre‑registration exactness.
4. **`PARAMETERS.md`:** Clarify that all `γ₄ⱼ` default = 0 is the null hypothesis for all coupling experiments; currently it is stated as “default = 0” only for some.
5. **`EVIDENCE.md`:** The line “Loss of KDM4B… demonstrates link between metabolism and epigenetics” – PMID 33571444 does indeed show a metabolic‑epigenetic link, but the statement is a stretch. Either rephrase or add a more direct reference.
